"[{'title': 'Ola Interview Experience Set 11 Internship', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ola-interview-experience-set-11-internship/', 'content_summary': ""Round 1 (Online Test): Four Programming Questions- a) Given a string find number of different substrings that are palindromes. b) In a matrix we can destruct it's one column by vanishing any of the element in column . We have to destruct the matrix completely so that sum of the elements destucted by us (not that destructed itself) is minimum, given the constraint that atleast one of the elements in a row should be canceled by us. Output is that minimum sum. c) Given N points in a grid we have to find all different(altlest one uncommon side) squares of side length K. N, K and points will be input and number of different squares will be output. d) Given an array we have to sort that in inceasing order such that value of V is minimum. where V = sum(position of element in given array * position of element sorted array), position of element is 1 based. Output is sorted array and V. Round 2 (Interview Round 1): Concepts of OOPs like Polymorphism and Inheritance and questions related to projects done. Round 3 (Interview Round 2): 1. Some more OOPs concepts. 2. Data Structures like Hashmap, Sorting algos (Quick sort and Merge sort) (complextiy and just how to implement them). 3. What is Java (as it was my primary programming language). 4. Difference between static and dynamic programming languages. 5. Implementation of Linked List (Code with proper syntax). 6. How to find Square root of a number (without using inbuilt functions, best efficient way O(logN)). 7. In a array each number is stored twice except one that is placed only once. (Best efficient O(logN)). 8. In a sorted array having elements from 1 to N, only one is missing and so array size is N-1. Find missing number in best efficient way (O(logN)) and without possibility of overflow.\nRelated Practice Problems\nCount Palindrome Sub-Strings of a String\nFind the element that appears once in sorted array\nAlone in couple\nCount Squares\nDistinct palindromic substrings\nMissing number in array\nAll Practice Problems for Ola-Cabs !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nOLA Interview Experience | Set 11 ( For Internship)""}, {'title': 'Intuit Interview Experience Set 12', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/intuit-interview-experience-set-12/', 'content_summary': 'Technical Round-1 \n1.

This was a medium level question, 7/11 test case passed using brute force (O(n^2)). An accurate solution of which is actually in O (n), but i modified my code and managed to get all the 11 test cases right using just a slight modification in my brute force approach! \n\nQ3)A matrix was given, the solution to which was by applying  BFS on it but not exactly that. I could not understand the problem enough as I was running out of time ! \nThe name of the Question was ""Marathon"" and said was a lot similar to some other famour problem named ""Rat in a maze"". \n\n In this round out of 150 students, 22 were shortlisted for interviews, and 10 were kept on waiting list. \n\nRound 2: TECHNICAL  I \n\nIn technical round one, all of us were asked 3 questions. The level of questions was actually easy, and most were selected only if they could answer all of the 3 right ! \n\nQ1) N-1 elements in an array from 1 to n, find the missing one! \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1\n\nI answered it easily so he added the constrain of over flowing numbers, which took me a little while but I got it \n\nQ2) K distance sort \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nearly-sorted-algorithm/0\n\nHe had clearly stated me that this can be done using normal sorting algo in O(nlogn), but I had to give a more optimized one. \n\nI proposed a solution using a stack, which some how worked for the test case that he gave me, but he proved it wrong and gave me a hint to use another data structure, I got the hint and realised it  was to be done using min heap. Time complexity of which was O(nlogk) ! \n\nQ3)Circular tour \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/circular-tour/1\n\n For this question i gave him a more optimized solution than brute force but with the same complexity, but he did not give me much time for this question as they were running late on schedule. \n\nLater I got to know from sources that I was rated 3.7 out of 5 in this round, which was more than a lot of others. \n\nRound 3: TECHNICAL   II \n\n17 out of 22 made it to this round. \n\nIn this round the questions asked were tough, but the interviewer was very suggestive and kept dropping hints. \n\nQ1)Sum of minimum elements of all sub arrays. \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-minimum-elements-of-all-subarrays/ \n\nI gave an immediate solution in nlogn time, but he asked me to optimize it. He gave me hell a lot of hints but I could not solve this easy question. He then said that they are running out of time so let\'s move to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ2)Cut off trees for golf \n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/ \n\nAfter a little bit of pickering I was able to give him a solution in O(r^2c^2), but he did not ask me to improve it. He asked me to write the code for it and tell me what algo was I using. I did write a rough algo just enough to give him a clear idea of what was I thinking and he was satisfied with that ! \nAnd we moved on to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ3) LRU cache implementation using array, stack/queue, doubly linked list, circular linked list, Hash map. \nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1\n\nI did them all very easily, and I also told him the story why was I good at it. He was happy enough to let me go again stating that time was a constrain and they had to take further interviews too ! \n\n  \n\nRound 4: HIRING MANAGER ROUND \n\nI was pretty confident that if I make it till here, I will get the job too, which is what happened. \nI entered the room, He asked me ""How was I "" and I told him"" I was hungry""......that did set the tone of the interview to a casual talk and made him comfortable with me. 5-10 mins into the interview, he commented that I was very honest. ANd so went on the conversation and the usual interview Questions. \n\nWhere do you see yourselves in 5 years? \n\nWhat is your strength and weakness? To which I answered as hard working, being both my weakness and strength and justified it . \n\nHe asked me about my story if JEE and getting into this college. \n\nHow did I grow technically and personality wise in the last 3 years? \n\nand usual questions like that ....to which I gave pretty interesting answers ! \n\nWe then discussed a little about any one of my projects of my choice and I some how led that discussion to about how every college group project is like one person doing the entire work, to him I also told that in one of the projects I did the entire work  and everyone got the credit, and how once in second year my partner did the entire project and I got pointers for it too. He was convinced that I was very honest and true !! \n\nAt last he asked me if I had any questions for him . \n\nI asked him only one question, which was that just in case if I get selected for this job at flipkart or even if I do not, what is that one thing that I should improve or learn about my technical part or my personality part. He did not say anything about my technical skills, He only said that he got a picture that I was not passionate enough . I also joined hands and agreed on it and gave a little justification on it. He also said that  I should not take that personally and that he only siad that because I asked so. \n\nThat is where the HM round ended. I got up, we shook hands and he said that mine was the best HM interview he had in the entire day(my was 2nd last interview of the day), and that he had an interesting conversation with me and truly enjoyed it ! \n\n  \n\nI was on Cloud 7 at the end of this interview. \n\nNext day the results were announced. Out of the 12 who appeared for the HM round. Only one candidate was rejected. 9 people (inclusive of me) we awarded  6 month internship + Full time job after that. 2 were awarded a 6 month internship and they would then evaluate their performance and see if they should hire them for full time or not ! Only one guy who made it to the HM round did not get an offer ! \n\n  \n\n \n \nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nFlipkart Interview Experience for SDE-1'}]",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1?page=1&company=Adobe&sortBy=submissions,2025-06-11T11:09:24.287531,GeeksforGeeks,Missing in Array,Easy,29.59%,1.4M,15m,"You are given an array arr[] of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).

If you have done some projects and is good with oop you will get through no need to practice specifically for this else brush up your OOP Designing skills and do some previous questions. I solved all the problems. The invigilator will be around checking your code all the time, SO NO SLOPPY CODING GUYS!! They need good code. Take a paper and figure out your aproch before solving each of them. And also check if you could use one problem to solve the other.

Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon. I said Java, Spring MVC for backend and html,css, javascript for front end and suddenly he asked what is difference between Java and javascript. Could not figure out at that time. Javascript is also an object oriented language an can be used at server side like node js.

There was no negative marking. Paper Coding round 21 students were shortlisted from the 1st MCQ round and in this round we were asked to write the codes (function only) of 3 questions in 1 hour time. Q1. You are given a matrix of size MxN and only possible values in the matrix are 0 - representing empty position 1 – representing a fresh apple 2 – representing a rotten apple A rotten apple converts all the fresh apples to rotten ones which are adjacent to it in 1 unit of time. Given an input the matrix and you have to calculate the amount of time in which all the fresh apples become rotten. Also determine whether all fresh apples could be made rotten in finite time or not. (20 marks) Input 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 0 2 1 After 1 time unit, the matrix will be transformed to 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 1 0 0 2 2 After 2 time units the matrix will look like 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 Hence output should be 2 time units. (Definition of adjacent only included the left , right, bottom and upper cell and NOT diagonal cell) Q2. You are given a Binary tree and you need to find out the maximum path sum between any 2 leaf nodes of the binary tree (The maximum path sum may or may not pass through root of tree). To be done in O(n) time (20 marks) Q3. You are given an unsorted array of integers and you need to find out whether there exists a majority element in it. (Majority element is one which appears more than n/2 times in an array of size n). To be done in O(n) time (10 Marks) The result of this round was declared late in the night. Some 7 or 8 students were called for the face to face interview rounds. I was the first one to be called and F2F rounds started at 11.30 PM and ended up in 5 AM in the morning :-p I was lucky to be free around 1.15 AM Face 2 Face Round 1 Q1. I couldn’t complete my Paper coding round question 1 (rotten apples). She (the interviewer) asked me to rectify the problem in it. I did it with the help of MxN extra space for visited[][] matrix. She said do it inplace. I did by modifying the Matrix values to 3 , 4 , etc. Q2. Find 5th from last element in a singly linked list. Firstly I gave a solution which took two traversals. She said to do it in 1 traversal only. I did it by taking two pointers and maintaining a distance of 5 nodes between them. Q3. You are given a string for example if input string is “I am abc xyz”. Output should be the modified string as “xyz abc am I” .This was to be done inplace and in O(n) time. Q4. You are given a unsorted array of both positive and negative integers. You need to find out the maximum sum subarray in O(n) time. You need to find the start and ending indexes along with the sum. Q5. You are given a BST and two keys k1 and k2. You need to find out the lowest common ancestor of the two keys Iteratively. I suggested the solution of storing the path in a vector and finding the 1st mismatch of key value in the root to k1 and root t k2 path. Face to Face round 2 Q1. Take the example of paper coding round rotten apples question and suggest some algorithm where you are allowed to change the position of rotten and fresh apples in such a way that the resultant matrix converts least number of fresh apples to rotten apples. I suggested an approach where I would first count the number of rotten and fresh apples initially and arrange all fresh apples in a sub-matrix starting from (0, 0) position and similarly arrange all rotten apples in sub-matrix from (N-1, M-1) position. He was satisfied with this approach Q2. You are given an elevator system with 3 elevators, you have to suggest some algorithm in which the amount of time that a person waiting on some x floor and has pressed the up or down button should wait for least amount of time and also the person inside the elevator also should not wait for too long to reach his destination floor. Q3. Asked some general questions as to what are tokens of a language. What is a grammar and production rules. Then he asked me to check whether a given code in some language is syntactically correct or not. You are provided the set of valid tokens for this language and also symbol table. Q4. You are given a text file storing characters or words. Suggest some way to compress the file such that there is always some amount of space compression possible. I suggested to use a trie tree as all the prefixes will share the space. He said this approach is dependent on whether the input has common prefixes or not. Suggest some other way. I then said that we can use Huffman Encoding and assign smallest code to most frequent word in the file and so on. He said again this approach also is dependent on whether your input has frequently occurring words or not. Then I suggested that since all characters can be represented in terms of 8 bits or 1 byte. We can take the XOR of prev and next character and store it in the current character position. This way I would be able to always get a n/2 size reduction in the encoded file. The idea was similar to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-linked-list-a-memory-efficient-doubly-linked-list-set-1/ He was satisfied and this was the end of my 2nd F2F round. He told me to get some sleep because you will be having a skype interview with our technical manager followed by HR round in the morning. 3rd round (Skype) Q1. He asked me to define NP and NP hard problems followed by the definition of automata and regular language. He then asked me are regular expressions. Q2. He shared a google doc with me and gave me a regular expression like abab*(a|b) and an input string s. I needed to write a code to check whether the given input string could be generated from this regular expression or not. Return a Boolean true or false value. I coded it up in 5 minutes :-p Q3. You are given a N-ary tree and a value K. You need to return true if there exists some root to leaf path having sum = k and false otherwise. I did it using recursion and in O(n) time. He told me that you’ll be having your final HR round in some time. I knew that I was going well because he seemed to be quite satisfied with my answers. Final HR round That was the round for which I’ve been waiting for hours She (the HR) started off with some general questions like tell me about yourself and your aims and goals in life. What are your hobbies. I told her that I love art and craft. She asked me what will I make for her if tomorrow is her birthday :-p She was very friendly and nice to talk to. It didn’t seem that I was talking to the HR. It was more like talking to a friend. She asked me what I liked about Accolite and why do I wish to join the company and stuff.

Every student got a different set of questions, mine was:\nIt was a very easy and known question of finding the nth term in a Fibonacci series. \nIt was like an encoding question where we have to change every alphabet of a string to an alphabet which is 3 places ahead in alphabetical order. The question was easy having a slight tricky corner case when we encounter alphabets like x, y, and z.\nIt was based on to validate a given IP Address.\nSince the test was so easy so those were able to solve all three questions and having c.g.p.a greater than 9 were promoted to the next round, around 40 students were selected for face-to-face interviews.\n1st Technical Interview(60-90 min): Since due to covid whole process happened virtually so our interviews took place on Microsoft Teams app, mine started at sharp 9 a.m. in the morning, Interview began with a formal introduction about me and my interviewer, then he started discussing my resume, where I have written a lot of things.\nHe started talking about my projects, recently I participated in the Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon, so I have a good project to explain which benefited me a lot. He asked a lot about tech-stack used in developing the project that was React.js for client interface and Django for server interface and python for ML model, he was well impressed with the way I overcome the problems faced during the course of the project, then without wasting more time on projects he shifted to the languages and new technologies that I mentioned my resume like blockchain, this whole conversation lasted for about 20-25 min.\nThen he asked me to code some standard coding questions, He asked me to share my screen and write code on any editor of my choice and language as well, I chose VS Code and c++ language.\nQuestions were quite easy but you have to keep on discussing each and every approach with your interviewer so that he can have a good understanding of what you are writing and to help you as well where you stuck.\nTo find the middle of a singly linked list.\nA program to check if a binary tree is BST or not or  A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not.\nHe has more focus on the time complexity of the programs not on space and told me to optimize my code as much as I could, At the last, he was happy with my optimized approach.\nThen he asked whether I had any questions from him or not and I asked a few questions and my interview ended, I was happy as it went so well.\nI started waiting for 2nd interview call and within 2 hours I got the mail to join the meeting for my 2nd technical interview.\n2nd Technical Interview(45 min): This round started with a good pace, he asked me to first code some problems and given me 3 questions to code, though they were easy he wanted to see my approach to solve these problems, \nTo find the column name from a given column number in Excel sheet \nTo reverse every word of a string without reversing the order of words.\nQuestion-based on Kadane Algorithm.\nAfter going through these questions he said so let's start talking about your projects and resume and started discussion about my projects again in detail, then he asked many questions on Node.js as I have written it as my first priority language for web development. \nQuestions on DBMS, indexing in DBMS, NoSQL, and SQL database, how they both operate on data, and explanations for a large system also.\nAfter getting answers to all these questions he asked some additional questions based on OOPS principles and Operating System basics, I answered them all, he was satisfied with the response.\nThen finally he asked his last question that Do you have any questions and I asked a few about the technologies that interns will be going to work on an internship, about the work culture of Microsoft.\nThis round too went well.\nAt around 6 p.m. I got a call for HR interview (the final round)\nHR Managerial Interview(30 min): This was the most mind relaxing and chill interview, HR used to ask about myself, my hobbies, my family background, and all those stuff. Then one more person joined the meeting I thought one of the head managers of the company he asked me some technical questions like to find the least common ancestor in a binary tree and some technical questions based on my projects I answered them all.\nThen HR wanted me to explain one of my good projects to him, I explained my SIH project to him, and he was happy with that.\nThe interview ended with some questions from my side about the culture at Microsoft.\nNote: At last 22 out of 40 students has been selected for SDE Internship at Microsoft\nSome tips\nBe confident throughout the process and if somehow you got stuck ask for some hints from your interviewer. He will love to help you.\nPractice as much as you can of coding questions from any of the trusted sites, I suggest go for GeeksforGeeks, they have the perfect set of questions for every company\nGo through all the past experiences of the company that you are going to give an interview to (All these stuff are available on GeeksforGeeks)\nAt last prepare with some questions to be asked from the interviewers at the end.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nMicrosoft Interview Experience for Internship""}, {'title': 'Adobe Shecodes Product Interview Experience For Internship 2020', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adobe-shecodes-product-interview-experience-for-internship-2020/', 'content_summary': 'Round 1 (Online Test): The first round was cocubes assessment and below is the test pattern:\nCognitive: 30 Questions, 30 min\nComputer Fundamental: 20 Questions, 20 min\nCoding: 2 Questions, 20min.\nThe cognitive section consists of Aptitude and verbal questions.

I was not able to answer almost all the answers correctly but gave almost 75% correct answers. The interviewer mainly focused on the problem-solving ability and the quality of conceptual knowledge. We were judged on 5 criteria in all the technical Interviews- DSA, Coding, Puzzles, Testing Questions and Operating system. 1: Basic Introductory Questions 2: 2-3 Puzzle Questions which we can easily find on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/ i: You have a birthday cake and have to cut it into 8 equal pieces by making 3 cuts only. How do you do it? ii: You are standing before two doors. One of the paths leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you don’t know who the honest one is and who the liar is.You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question? 3: Some basic Questions on DSA- about stacks, queue, arrays, memory storage accessing, Advantages and Dis of the Linked list over arrays, 4: Operating System: In all the rounds, Operating System questions were asked in abundance. Though the questions were basic, they focused more on our concepts like how easily we were able to explain it to them. Questions on Kernels, Types of Kernel, Why OS, memory allocation in OS were asked. 5: Test Cases Question: We have to think and answer the possible questions while testing the cases. i: Test cases for a login page window. 6: Heavy discussions on the projects I have done. Why we preferred to use a particular technology. What was my role in the project and so on. 7: I was asked to code some questions. i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1 ii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-second-largest-element2406/1 iii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-loop-in-linked-list/1 After a wait of about 15 minutes, I was called for my second round of Interview.  \nFourth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 2\nThis round of interview was taken by a senior person of the company. It was a bit lengthy as we had more of a discussion rather than just a QnA round. The interview went for more than 90 minutes and was tougher than the first round. 1: There was a long discussion on what I have written in my resume. The projects I had done, Extracurricular and co-curricular activities I had written on the resume, the skills I have mentioned. All of it. So be careful of whatever you mention in the resume. 2: Next he asked me a bunch of coding questions which were some very popular ones i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/anagram-1587115620/1 ii: Implementation of Merge Sort https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/ iii: Implementing Queue using stacks and Stack using queues. iv:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-repeated-character4108/1 I was asked to code in my preferred language. So there wasn’t any language barrier and for all the questions the interviewer asked for the most optimized approach. As I was able to answer all the questions, I wasn’t asked any more questions. 3: After the coding questions, I was asked a lot of questions about Operation System and OOPS. i:   Fragmentation- Internal and External ii:  Concepts of Kernel iii:  File Management iv:  Virtual functions and Friend Functions v:  Function Overloading And Overriding vi: What is paging and Demand Paging? 4: Interview puzzles: i: The mislabeled Jar puzzle https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-mislabeled-jars/ ii: Maximize probability of White Ball https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-12-maximize-probability-of-white-ball/ iii:  100 Prisoners with Red/Black Hats https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-13-100-prisoners-with-redblack-hats/ 5:  Testing Based Questions- i: Five new inventions in a glass frame and the test cases to test the working a frame. ii: Design test cases for a shopping application. The interviewer was quite satisfied with the test cases I answered. As the main trick to solve these kinds of interview questions is to design the test cases by giving every small function an eye and then forming all possible scenarios for the same.  \nFifth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 3 + MANAGERIAL ROUND\n  This was also similar to the last two Technical Interviews and was also easier from them. The interview went for about 70 minutes and It was tilted more towards the managerial side and less Technical was asked. 1: Program to Count set bits in an integer. (I answered 4 possible solutions to him and he was satisfied)  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-bits0143/1 2: Working of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort ( I was asked to dry run the solution mainly to check the internal working of swapping and comparison) 3: Torch and Bridge https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/ 4:  Some Mathematical Puzzles 5: Design test cases for OLA Application 6: Design test cases for GMAIL Application 7: Situation based questions 8: What is a Semaphore and operations on a semaphore? 9: What is context switching?  \nSixth Round - HR INTERVIEW\nIt was the last round and an eliminatory round as well.  The interviewer was pretty cool. After the introduction, I was asked questions like where are you from? What is special about you?  Why should we select you? Which was your favorite subject last semester? Which Adobe products you liked the most and why? It was a 20 minutes long discussion round about college life, interests, and hobbies. The HR also asked our preferred joining location between Noida and Bangalore which gave us many hopes of our selection. Three candidates from our college went to the HR Round. Two days later we received the confirmation mail that two students are selected.

Two elements arr[i] and arr[j] form an inversion if arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j.
Inversion Count: For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0.
If an array is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum.
Examples:

There were in a total of 5 rounds. First Round (Online Coding + Aptitude): Firstly don’t expect the online interface to be friendly. There were 3 sections. First section was aptitude which had very very simple questions like addition, subtraction. Second section had a single coding question and the third section had 2 coding questions. All the three coding questions were basic DP and bruteforce. You just had to pass the hidden testcases taking care of the limits. 1. Find the no. of trailing zeros in n factorial. 2. Given an equation Cukoo(n) = Cukoo(n-2)*2 + Cukoo(n-1) -3 (something like this) find Cukoo(n) for a given large input. 3. Don’t remember. Second Round (Technical Interview): The interviewer went through my resume and asked several questions from it. He took one of my projects and had a long discussion over it. Also he asked me to write a few functions that I had used in it. Then he asked me several questions: 1. Given 2 trees, find if one tree is a subtree of other. Write complete code explaining your approach. 2. Given two functions of which one function prints the series of odd numbers (like 1 3 5 7 …) and the other prints the series of even numbers (like 2 4 6 8…). How will you use these two functions to print a consecutive number series i.e., 1 2 3 4 5 6…. I used monitors(semaphores) and he was convinced. Third round (Technical Interview): The interviewer was very friendly. He asked several questions: 1. What is diamond problem? How do you deal with it (both in c++ and java)? Then he discussed about multiple inheritance in c++ and java. 2. Questions on polymorphism, virtual class, etc. What is vptr? Again a long discussion over the properties of classes and objects. 3. Implement strcpy and strcmp functions of C with all the corner cases covered. Fourth round (Technical Interview): 1. What are ACID properties? How are they implemented? How are all the 4 properties taken care of in the real-time applications? 2. What are threads? What is the difference between a thread and a process? 3. Find cycle in a graph. Compare different approaches. He was very particular about the DFS approach. 4. Given a grid representing a maze, find out if there is only a single path to enter the maze and exit. You can view the problem as to check if there are exactly two points on the outer boundary of the grid and there is exactly one path connecting these two points. Fifth round (HR): General questions starting with the traditional “tell me about yourself”.

Note: We are considering that BSTs can not contain duplicate Nodes.
A BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Examples:
Input: root = [2, 1, 3, N, N, N, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The left subtree of every node contains smaller keys and right subtree of every node contains greater keys. Hence, the tree is a BST.
Input: root = [2, N, 7, N, 6, N, 9]
Output: false
Explanation: Since the node to the right of node with key 7 has lesser key value, hence it is not a valid BST.

All they asked at first was about Projects done in my company and at college level. 2. Then main thing they ask was OS and its concepts:      \na. Memory management.      \nb. CPU scheduling.      \nc. Deadlock and its real time examples.      \nd. Questions on how two processes can communicate in OS, give different ways.\n3. Coding questions:      \nReverse a linked list.\nPrint left view of a binary tree.\nImplement your own memcpy. After completion of this round they asked me if I can travel to Hyderabad for further rounds.At 7th January 2017 I gave F2F interview.\nRound-2 F2F:120 minutes\nHe started with simple intro then explained me the position for which interview was going on. 1. Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word \'is\' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find \'is\' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using ""strcmp"" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1. Then he started with questions on OS      \na. Process and thread difference.      \nb. How will you handle 2 thread working on same MAP.Then asked several questions on mutex and different types of locking systems.      \nc. Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation?

I converted the whole problem into a graph where each node will have connections to its next k-1 nodes and also connection to a node to which a bridge or tunnel on that node leads (if any bridge or tunnel is there at that node) and then Applied BFS. He then asked me to write code on paper. Complexity-O(n*k) 2. Given a linked list having loop, detect the loop and return the starting point of that loop. 3. He asked me about what is map (general concept of map not language specific as in c++ or java). He then told me to design a data structure using the basic data structures such that searching in that can be done in O(1) in 95% cases and in 5% cases searching can take more than O(1) and the element to be searched can be an integer or a string. I told him to take hash of string in any way (multiplying by prime nos etc.) and then take modulo 10^6 as maximum size of array can be 10^6. He then asked me how will I remove collisions occurring due to same hash value. I told him to use chaining with a balanced BST at the collision index in order to achieve minimum complexity (o(logn)). He then asked me that if suppose during 1 year only 100 elements were required to be stored in array and searched in above problem and after 1 year elements become 10^6, then during 1 year a lot of memory will be wasted if I allocate 10^6 initially; he asked me how would I do this. I told him that initially allocate memory of array of 100 size and then after 1 year, allocate a new memory of 10^6 elements and copy elements from original array to new array. This round lasted for about 1 hour. 4th round (Managerial Round)- It was a short round of nearly 10-15 minutes. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself. He then asked me why do I want to join Walmart. Why don’t I want to pursue higher studies, difference between job and career and what does I want, job or a career? He then asked me what do I want to achieve in the next 5 Years. He then asked a brief description about the project mentioned in my resume. 5th round (HR Round)- It was also a short round of nearly 5-10 minutes. HR asked me to introduce myself. Asked me about my hobbies. One of my hobbies mentioned was reading newsfeed on quora so she asked whether Iwas active on quora and what all topics do I follow on quora.

Interview process was divided into 4 rounds(including initial Computer based screening round) . All the interview rounds were held virtual.\nRound 1\nIt was the online coding round consisting of 3 questions of Medium Hard difficulty level .\nTest Pattern : \nProblem 1(Easy Medium problem Related to quick sort) : 50 pts, \nProblem 2 : (Hard Level Problem) 75 pts. \nProblem 3 : Similar to Weighted Job Scheduling(Greedy + DP) {https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling/} : 100 pts.\nI did P1 & P3 complete and p2 partial , got selected to further interview rounds.\nRound 2\nIt was a resume screening + DSA round . Initially , a brief introduction was given by them & later , they started with projects listed in my resume . They first asked me to explain about the projects , asked some questions related to its implementation & its actual use case in real world (where it can be used) .Later , they switched to DSA part , a total of 2 questions of easy medium difficulty level were asked . I only remember 1 question that was similar to Minimum platform problem(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-platforms-1587115620/1) .\nAfter this , They asked me for favourite subjects. I said Operation Systems . Then , they asked for some concepts in OS , including CPU scheduling  & its algos like Round robin , SJF etc and later asked which type of scheduling algorithm is used to design actual systems . \n{This round lasted for 45-50 mins}\nRound 3 \nIt was System design round.Though , it also started with a brief introduction & later , asked about projects . As my project was related to test classification . In that context , they asked me to design a low level Suggestion system(In any preferred language) .\nSuggestion System : Given a dictionary of millions of words . Also , a list of words for which suggestions needs to be made as in Google search when we type something its suggestions come from which we can select .For eg : \nInput : Dictionary : [CAT , CATS , CATALOGE , METTLE ,METAL , FITTING]\nList of words :  [CAT , DOG , MET , FIT]\nFor each word in input list suggestions needs to be made & returned .\nOutput : [ [CAT , CATS , CATALOGE] , [] , [METTLE , MET] , [FITTING] ]\nFirstly , i gave a bruteforce approach i.e to check each word in dictionary whether word in list is prefix of that or not. this approach was an O(N * W) time where W is length of word. Later , i suggested a trie based approach in which we can insert all words in dictionary to trie as pre-processing step , and for suggestions , we can query on trie to find all the words with that prefix . As trie is space efficient so they later asked to optimize on time complexity if there are a lot billions of queries which was O(W) where W is total character in suggested list . For that , i suggested to use a hashmap to store results that are obtained previously thus , saved can be used for later queries.\nThis Round lasted for 50-55 mins\nRound 4 (Grad Values & Management Interview Round)\nIt was an hr cum Value based round with Director & Engineering manager . No technical stuff was asked . But , a lot of resume discussion and Atlassian values questions were asked .\nThis Round lasted for 60-65 mins\nThis concludes my interview experience with Atlassian.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of platforms required at the station to ensure that no train is kept waiting.
At any given time, the same platform cannot be used for both the arrival of one train and the departure of another. Therefore, when two trains arrive at the same time, or when one arrives before another departs, additional platforms are required to accommodate both trains.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800], dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three trains during the time 9:40 to 12:00. So we need a minimum of 3 platforms.
Input: arr[] = [900, 1235, 1100], dep[] = [1000, 1240, 1200]
Output: 1
Explanation: All train times are mutually exclusive. So we need only one platform
Input: arr[] = [1000, 935, 1100], dep[] = [1200, 1240, 1130]
Output: 3
Explanation: All 3 trains have to be there from 11:00 to 11:30
Constraints:
1≤ number of trains ≤ 50000
0000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ dep[i] ≤ 2359

"[{'title': 'Vmware Interview Experience Set 9 Internship Rd', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vmware-interview-experience-set-9-internship-rd/', 'content_summary': ""Vmware conducted their online exam via hirepro. Round 1 : There were 3 sections quants, Technical questions and OOPs based questions, no section had negative marks and all questions were MCQs. The quantitative section had 10 questions and we were given 15 minutes, the questions covered all the typical quants topics (like time and work, mixtures & allegations etc.). The questions were hard and were time consuming the trick was to identify the questions you could solve(I could solve only 4). Next there were 23 technical questions, they were easy and medium level, from all topics(OS, CN, Computer Architecture etc.). Then we had a choice before the OOPs section to opt for either Java or C++, I chose java and had to answer 7 tricky questions mostly focusing on inheritance and how constructors work with inheritance. Around 150 students gave the first round from which 42 progressed. Round 2: This was a face to face technical round. I introduced myself and then the interviewer directly jumped onto my projects and asked me to talk about them. I had made an android app which I showed him(I carried my phone) my second project particularly took his attention which was based on Machine Learning I had to explain my project in detail for about 15-20 minutes. He asked me questions on all topics like OOPS, Data Structures, OS, CN. Before beginning he asked me to rate my proficiency in c,c++& JAVA on a scale from 1 to 10. To the best of my memory the questions were: 1) Explain properties of OOPS. (tried to confuse me) 2) Types of constructors. (wanted to hear copy constructor and how it is defined in different ways in c++ and java.) 3) Gave me a typical inherent scenario and asked me how parent class and child class default constructors are called. 4) Asked me to detect& remove loop in a linked list. (I told him I already knew the algo. so we moved on) 5) Asked me to write the expression for height of a complete binary tree. 6) Array to BST (tried to convince me a solution which could give a skewed tree was better) 7) Asked me about different CPU scheduling algo and made me solve a given scenario for wait time and turn around time using different scheduling algos. 8) Asked me about gateway routers and asked me to calculate subnet mask for a given range of IPs. The interviewer tried to pressure me into changing my answers being confident was the key. Round 2 : This was the second technical face to face round. My interviewer was problem-solvingmmediately made me comfortable. After talking about my project in detail, he moved on to problem solving and asked me just 2 questions. 1) Given a sparse 2D matrix (containing 0s and 1s) I had to make all entries of a row and column '1' which had at least one entry as '1'. I gave a O(n^2) solution using hashing he asked me to write down the complete code. 2) In a binary tree find the the level with maximum number of nodes. A typical solution would be Level order traversal but I gave a different solution by connecting all the nodes in a particular level. 6 students cleared the 2nd technical round. Round 3: It was a managerial discussion round, which was basically a telephonic interview with the manager. Other students were asked few technical questions , the interview was more focused on judging your attitude and if you were a good fit for the team. My telephonic interview was mostly about my Machine Learning project, mild business acumen and why I wanted to do an internship at Vmware. Round 4: The final round was the hr round, I was asked about my family background and what would be my reaction if I don't get this internship. Finally all 6 who cleared the technical rounds were selected for a 6 months internship at Vmware, Bangalore. Also we were given vmware bottles :p\nRelated Practice Problems\nMaximum Width of Tree\nRemove loop in Linked List\nHeight of Binary Tree\nArray to BST\nBoolean Matrix Problem\nAll Practice Problems for VMWare !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nVmware Interview Experience | Set 9 (Internship (R&D))""}, {'title': 'Walmart Labs Interview Experience Set 2 On Campus', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/walmart-labs-interview-experience-set-2-on-campus/', 'content_summary': '1st round (Written Test) It was an online test of 90 minutes and was conducted on Hackerearth. It consisted of 10 MCQ’s and 3 coding questions. MCQ’s consisted of general aptitude questions, questions related to networking, programming etc and very easy. The coding questions were as follows: 1. http://www.spoj.com/problems/FARIDA/. The question was exactly this. (standard dp problem). (35 marks for this question). 2. Given arrival and departure time of employees in an office. Find the maximum no of chairs needed so that at no instance, an employee has to stand. (30 marks question). Example- Input- 5.00 6.00 7.00 6.30 7.00 8.00 Output-2 It is similar to this. The main thing in this question was reading the input as number of employees was not given beforehand. It was also asked to check for all INVALID inputs and return -1 in those cases. 3. Given a 2D matrix of n x m. The matrix contained integers. Given a source position of a person and a destination position, find the number of ways in which that person can reach destination from source fulfilling the following conditions- (i) Movement can be only in north, south, east or west direction. (ii) A person can move from one cell to other if and only if that cell has value less than the value in current cell. (standard bfs problem). (25 marks question). 2nd round (Technical Interview)- 1. Given a binary tree, print its bottom view. She asked me to write the code on paper. 2. Given a character array and a dictionary, find the no. of valid sentences that can be made by putting space after any character in this array. A valid sentence is the one whose all the words are present in the dictionary. Write code on paper. Example- Input- catsanddog Output- 2 (cat sand dog & cats and dog) 3.

This round lasted for about 1 hour. 3rd round (Technical Interview)- 1. Given an array and a frog, there can be a bridge from any index to any index in forward direction and a tunnel from any index to any other index in backward direction. Frog is initially at -1 index. Given an integer k, from can hop at most k-1 times. i.e. if k=4 and frog initially is at -1, then it can reach cell 0,1,2 (3 hops at max). A frog on landing on a cell containing a bridge or a tunnel can avoid using that bridge or tunnel and stay there only. Find the minimum no. of steps in which the frog can reach a given destination ‘D’.

I was not able to answer almost all the answers correctly but gave almost 75% correct answers. The interviewer mainly focused on the problem-solving ability and the quality of conceptual knowledge. We were judged on 5 criteria in all the technical Interviews- DSA, Coding, Puzzles, Testing Questions and Operating system. 1: Basic Introductory Questions 2: 2-3 Puzzle Questions which we can easily find on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/ i: You have a birthday cake and have to cut it into 8 equal pieces by making 3 cuts only. How do you do it? ii: You are standing before two doors. One of the paths leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you don’t know who the honest one is and who the liar is.You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question? 3: Some basic Questions on DSA- about stacks, queue, arrays, memory storage accessing, Advantages and Dis of the Linked list over arrays, 4: Operating System: In all the rounds, Operating System questions were asked in abundance. Though the questions were basic, they focused more on our concepts like how easily we were able to explain it to them. Questions on Kernels, Types of Kernel, Why OS, memory allocation in OS were asked. 5: Test Cases Question: We have to think and answer the possible questions while testing the cases. i: Test cases for a login page window. 6: Heavy discussions on the projects I have done. Why we preferred to use a particular technology. What was my role in the project and so on. 7: I was asked to code some questions. i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1 ii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-second-largest-element2406/1 iii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-loop-in-linked-list/1 After a wait of about 15 minutes, I was called for my second round of Interview.  \nFourth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 2\nThis round of interview was taken by a senior person of the company. It was a bit lengthy as we had more of a discussion rather than just a QnA round. The interview went for more than 90 minutes and was tougher than the first round. 1: There was a long discussion on what I have written in my resume. The projects I had done, Extracurricular and co-curricular activities I had written on the resume, the skills I have mentioned. All of it. So be careful of whatever you mention in the resume. 2: Next he asked me a bunch of coding questions which were some very popular ones i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/anagram-1587115620/1 ii: Implementation of Merge Sort https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/ iii: Implementing Queue using stacks and Stack using queues. iv:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-repeated-character4108/1 I was asked to code in my preferred language. So there wasn’t any language barrier and for all the questions the interviewer asked for the most optimized approach. As I was able to answer all the questions, I wasn’t asked any more questions. 3: After the coding questions, I was asked a lot of questions about Operation System and OOPS. i:   Fragmentation- Internal and External ii:  Concepts of Kernel iii:  File Management iv:  Virtual functions and Friend Functions v:  Function Overloading And Overriding vi: What is paging and Demand Paging? 4: Interview puzzles: i: The mislabeled Jar puzzle https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-mislabeled-jars/ ii: Maximize probability of White Ball https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-12-maximize-probability-of-white-ball/ iii:  100 Prisoners with Red/Black Hats https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-13-100-prisoners-with-redblack-hats/ 5:  Testing Based Questions- i: Five new inventions in a glass frame and the test cases to test the working a frame. ii: Design test cases for a shopping application. The interviewer was quite satisfied with the test cases I answered. As the main trick to solve these kinds of interview questions is to design the test cases by giving every small function an eye and then forming all possible scenarios for the same.  \nFifth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 3 + MANAGERIAL ROUND\n  This was also similar to the last two Technical Interviews and was also easier from them. The interview went for about 70 minutes and It was tilted more towards the managerial side and less Technical was asked. 1: Program to Count set bits in an integer. (I answered 4 possible solutions to him and he was satisfied)  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-bits0143/1 2: Working of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort ( I was asked to dry run the solution mainly to check the internal working of swapping and comparison) 3: Torch and Bridge https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/ 4:  Some Mathematical Puzzles 5: Design test cases for OLA Application 6: Design test cases for GMAIL Application 7: Situation based questions 8: What is a Semaphore and operations on a semaphore? 9: What is context switching?  \nSixth Round - HR INTERVIEW\nIt was the last round and an eliminatory round as well.  The interviewer was pretty cool. After the introduction, I was asked questions like where are you from? What is special about you?  Why should we select you? Which was your favorite subject last semester? Which Adobe products you liked the most and why? It was a 20 minutes long discussion round about college life, interests, and hobbies. The HR also asked our preferred joining location between Noida and Bangalore which gave us many hopes of our selection. Three candidates from our college went to the HR Round. Two days later we received the confirmation mail that two students are selected.

There were in a total of 5 rounds. First Round (Online Coding + Aptitude): Firstly don’t expect the online interface to be friendly. There were 3 sections. First section was aptitude which had very very simple questions like addition, subtraction. Second section had a single coding question and the third section had 2 coding questions. All the three coding questions were basic DP and bruteforce. You just had to pass the hidden testcases taking care of the limits. 1. Find the no. of trailing zeros in n factorial. 2. Given an equation Cukoo(n) = Cukoo(n-2)*2 + Cukoo(n-1) -3 (something like this) find Cukoo(n) for a given large input. 3. Don’t remember. Second Round (Technical Interview): The interviewer went through my resume and asked several questions from it. He took one of my projects and had a long discussion over it. Also he asked me to write a few functions that I had used in it. Then he asked me several questions: 1. Given 2 trees, find if one tree is a subtree of other. Write complete code explaining your approach. 2. Given two functions of which one function prints the series of odd numbers (like 1 3 5 7 …) and the other prints the series of even numbers (like 2 4 6 8…). How will you use these two functions to print a consecutive number series i.e., 1 2 3 4 5 6…. I used monitors(semaphores) and he was convinced. Third round (Technical Interview): The interviewer was very friendly. He asked several questions: 1. What is diamond problem? How do you deal with it (both in c++ and java)? Then he discussed about multiple inheritance in c++ and java. 2. Questions on polymorphism, virtual class, etc. What is vptr? Again a long discussion over the properties of classes and objects. 3. Implement strcpy and strcmp functions of C with all the corner cases covered. Fourth round (Technical Interview): 1. What are ACID properties? How are they implemented? How are all the 4 properties taken care of in the real-time applications? 2. What are threads? What is the difference between a thread and a process? 3. Find cycle in a graph. Compare different approaches. He was very particular about the DFS approach. 4. Given a grid representing a maze, find out if there is only a single path to enter the maze and exit. You can view the problem as to check if there are exactly two points on the outer boundary of the grid and there is exactly one path connecting these two points. Fifth round (HR): General questions starting with the traditional “tell me about yourself”.

A total of 50 test cases have to be cleared in order to clear this round. Those who have cleared this test will only be shortlisted for further rounds. If you are unable to clear this round in 3 hours, you will be given another chance i.e. another question that has to solved in 3 hours again. Usually this second attempt would be much straight forward to clear (will be standard repeated question of Samsung). I suggest the aspirants to go through all the coding questions from experiences of Samsung. Coding questions solved by me are:\nAttempt 1: A game like mario, where you have to reach the end point in the minimum distance. Can be solved using shortest path algorithms. Due to complexity of the problem, I was only able to clear 40 out of 50 test cases. Because of which I was asked to take second attempt.\nAttempt 2: Given a graph, find whether a cycle exists. If so, print the cycle in sorted order. It was a easy question and was qualified for further rounds.\nRound 2: It was a techincal interview round. The interview started with discussion on my rojects, questions on operating systems, indepth discussion about pointers and easy problem solving questions. It was pretty easy interview to crack to. Just be confident with basics in order to clear this round. Round 3: It was HR round which was just for formality. Asked to speak about any latest technology and discussion about joining date and formalities. Got the offer in the next week. Verdict: Selected.

I did the question using the concepts of bitmasking. 13 candidates were shortlisted out of about 150.\nTech Interview This was a pretty long interview which went on for about 2 hours. The interviewer was very helpful and experienced, he already knew of the common errors a candidate would make and was giving hints and ample time. He asked me about 13-14 questions related to C, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, Pointers in C, etc. Some questions were: implement a stack using a inked list. Given a function with a source pointer, destination pointer and the length in bytes copy the data from the source pointer address to the destination pointer address. In a social network, suggest friends of friends of friends to a user. In a directed graph detect the presence of a cycle etc. 5 candidates made it through the next round.\nTech Interview This round lasted for about 30 mins. This was sort of only a cross check round regarding the projects and the interviewer was looking for someone with a Machine Learning project. He asked whether I think I would be a good fit with Samsung and told some things about the work there. I had a Deep Learning project in my resume and he asked me to explain how it worked, I explained that to him for about 10 mins and he seemed satisfied with my explanation. He then asked me why I wanted to join Samsung and some more general questions. He then told me that I would be going through to the HR interview round and said that he expects that I would make it through. Before the interviewers left they shook hands with the 5 candidates and said that they expected all of us to meet them in the Samsung campus next year.\nHR interview The HR was quite sick and thus didn't come to the college campus. A telephonic interview was held next night for 5 candidates. The interview started with normal greetings. Then he asked me why I didn't do a Summer Internship despite my background into competitive coding(Summer Internship is not mandatory in my college). He then asked me whether I think I would get selected. Then he asked about what I know of the work being done in SRI Bangalore, I mentioned AI, IoT, Data Intelligence etc. He then asked me to explain what AI is, further he asked me to explain how is intelligence added in machines, I mentioned there are algorithms like Regression, Clustering etc. He then asked me to give an overview of what regression is. He then asked me whether I had any questions. I asked a question, he answered and then the interview got over. The interview lasted only 8 mins.\nThe results were declared in the morning and finally, 3 candidates were offered Internship + Jobs.

Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word \'is\' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find \'is\' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using ""strcmp"" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1.

Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation?

Equation consisted of addition operator only and 2 integers and a variable ‘x’. Sample Input Case: x+3=5 output=2 Decoding the string into 2 numbers and an unknown variable took a lot of time. 2. Given two numbers x and y find x^y in log y time. 3. Find the next palindromic number greater than the current number. Had solved all 3 questions and around 15 questions in aptitude. Was shortlisted for the next round. Technical Interview 1 ( 1 Hour 20 mins ) Firstly the interviewer asked me to introduce myself, asked me about my projects. Then he moved on to coding questions and puzzles and some basic object oriented fundamentals: All the questions below were in random order. 1. Questions related to collections, interfaces, JBM, JDE, Polymorphism and Abstraction. 2. Coding question : Full codes to be written a> Given an array comprising of only 1’s and 0’s , find the maximum length along with the starting indexand ending index which consisted equal number of 1’s and 0’s. I could not do it, the interviewer gave me another question: Given an array comprising of any number ( both positive and negative), find the maximum length alongwith starting and ending index which had sum equal to 0. I was able to do this one. The interviewer told me to solve the previous question now. I told him that replace all the 0’s with -1’s and the question becomes entirely the same. b> To Check whether a binary tree is a BST or not? 3. Puzzles: 1. There are 3 switches outside a room. Inside the room there is only 1 bulb. You could go inside the room only once, how will you know with which bulb the switch is associated with. 2. There are 100 coins in a table. 20 coins are heads and others are tails (facing upwards). Find the optimal cut(2 piles) such that both have equal number of heads facing up.Technical Interview 2 ( 1 hr ) Technical Interview 2 ( 1 hr ) Coding Questions: 1.

She first asked me to introduce myself to her We had a long discussion on one of my internships at a startup and what role I played in the product I developed. Then she proceeded to the DSA Questions  1. Convert a series of strings to their integer form I gave multiple solutions like direct functions to do so in java, then she told me to give a solution without the function I gave a hashmap solution with keys as string version of the number and values as integer which was O(1) She further told me remove the hashmap, then I said we could directly extract characters and return ascii values. She was satisfied with all the solutions. 2. Find the pair in Array of integers that sum upto 'x' I gave a naive solution first with O(n^2) then further used sum of subsets and gave a O(2^n) solution I couldn't think of a O(n) solution so quickly. The link of the solution is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKMZXc0jQU (I realised how easy it was after the interview.. Oops!) 3.

Your task is to determine if the linked list contains a loop. A loop exists in a linked list if the next pointer of the last node points to any other node in the list (including itself), rather than being null.
Custom Input format:
A head of a singly linked list and a pos (1-based index) which denotes the position of the node to which the last node points to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop.
Examples:
Input: head: 1 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 2
Output: true
Explanation: There exists a loop as last node is connected back to the second node.
Input: head: 1 -> 8 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There exists no loop in given linked list.
Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 1

Output is sorted array and V. Round 2 (Interview Round 1): Concepts of OOPs like Polymorphism and Inheritance and questions related to projects done. Round 3 (Interview Round 2): 1. Some more OOPs concepts. 2. Data Structures like Hashmap, Sorting algos (Quick sort and Merge sort) (complextiy and just how to implement them). 3. What is Java (as it was my primary programming language). 4. Difference between static and dynamic programming languages. 5. Implementation of Linked List (Code with proper syntax). 6. How to find Square root of a number (without using inbuilt functions, best efficient way O(logN)). 7. In a array each number is stored twice except one that is placed only once. (Best efficient O(logN)). 8. In a sorted array having elements from 1 to N, only one is missing and so array size is N-1. Find missing number in best efficient way (O(logN)) and without possibility of overflow.\nRelated Practice Problems\nCount Palindrome Sub-Strings of a String\nFind the element that appears once in sorted array\nAlone in couple\nCount Squares\nDistinct palindromic substrings\nMissing number in array\nAll Practice Problems for Ola-Cabs !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nOLA Interview Experience | Set 11 ( For Internship)""}, {'title': 'Intuit Interview Experience Set 12', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/intuit-interview-experience-set-12/', 'content_summary': 'Technical Round-1 \n1.

This was a medium level question, 7/11 test case passed using brute force (O(n^2)). An accurate solution of which is actually in O (n), but i modified my code and managed to get all the 11 test cases right using just a slight modification in my brute force approach! \n\nQ3)A matrix was given, the solution to which was by applying  BFS on it but not exactly that. I could not understand the problem enough as I was running out of time ! \nThe name of the Question was ""Marathon"" and said was a lot similar to some other famour problem named ""Rat in a maze"". \n\n In this round out of 150 students, 22 were shortlisted for interviews, and 10 were kept on waiting list. \n\nRound 2: TECHNICAL  I \n\nIn technical round one, all of us were asked 3 questions. The level of questions was actually easy, and most were selected only if they could answer all of the 3 right ! \n\nQ1) N-1 elements in an array from 1 to n, find the missing one! \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1\n\nI answered it easily so he added the constrain of over flowing numbers, which took me a little while but I got it \n\nQ2) K distance sort \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nearly-sorted-algorithm/0\n\nHe had clearly stated me that this can be done using normal sorting algo in O(nlogn), but I had to give a more optimized one. \n\nI proposed a solution using a stack, which some how worked for the test case that he gave me, but he proved it wrong and gave me a hint to use another data structure, I got the hint and realised it  was to be done using min heap. Time complexity of which was O(nlogk) ! \n\nQ3)Circular tour \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/circular-tour/1\n\n For this question i gave him a more optimized solution than brute force but with the same complexity, but he did not give me much time for this question as they were running late on schedule. \n\nLater I got to know from sources that I was rated 3.7 out of 5 in this round, which was more than a lot of others. \n\nRound 3: TECHNICAL   II \n\n17 out of 22 made it to this round. \n\nIn this round the questions asked were tough, but the interviewer was very suggestive and kept dropping hints. \n\nQ1)Sum of minimum elements of all sub arrays. \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-minimum-elements-of-all-subarrays/ \n\nI gave an immediate solution in nlogn time, but he asked me to optimize it. He gave me hell a lot of hints but I could not solve this easy question. He then said that they are running out of time so let\'s move to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ2)Cut off trees for golf \n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/ \n\nAfter a little bit of pickering I was able to give him a solution in O(r^2c^2), but he did not ask me to improve it. He asked me to write the code for it and tell me what algo was I using. I did write a rough algo just enough to give him a clear idea of what was I thinking and he was satisfied with that ! \nAnd we moved on to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ3) LRU cache implementation using array, stack/queue, doubly linked list, circular linked list, Hash map. \nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1\n\nI did them all very easily, and I also told him the story why was I good at it. He was happy enough to let me go again stating that time was a constrain and they had to take further interviews too ! \n\n  \n\nRound 4: HIRING MANAGER ROUND \n\nI was pretty confident that if I make it till here, I will get the job too, which is what happened. \nI entered the room, He asked me ""How was I "" and I told him"" I was hungry""......that did set the tone of the interview to a casual talk and made him comfortable with me. 5-10 mins into the interview, he commented that I was very honest. ANd so went on the conversation and the usual interview Questions. \n\nWhere do you see yourselves in 5 years? \n\nWhat is your strength and weakness? To which I answered as hard working, being both my weakness and strength and justified it . \n\nHe asked me about my story if JEE and getting into this college. \n\nHow did I grow technically and personality wise in the last 3 years? \n\nand usual questions like that ....to which I gave pretty interesting answers ! \n\nWe then discussed a little about any one of my projects of my choice and I some how led that discussion to about how every college group project is like one person doing the entire work, to him I also told that in one of the projects I did the entire work  and everyone got the credit, and how once in second year my partner did the entire project and I got pointers for it too. He was convinced that I was very honest and true !! \n\nAt last he asked me if I had any questions for him . \n\nI asked him only one question, which was that just in case if I get selected for this job at flipkart or even if I do not, what is that one thing that I should improve or learn about my technical part or my personality part. He did not say anything about my technical skills, He only said that he got a picture that I was not passionate enough . I also joined hands and agreed on it and gave a little justification on it. He also said that  I should not take that personally and that he only siad that because I asked so. \n\nThat is where the HM round ended. I got up, we shook hands and he said that mine was the best HM interview he had in the entire day(my was 2nd last interview of the day), and that he had an interesting conversation with me and truly enjoyed it ! \n\n  \n\nI was on Cloud 7 at the end of this interview. \n\nNext day the results were announced. Out of the 12 who appeared for the HM round. Only one candidate was rejected. 9 people (inclusive of me) we awarded  6 month internship + Full time job after that. 2 were awarded a 6 month internship and they would then evaluate their performance and see if they should hire them for full time or not !

Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon. I said Java, Spring MVC for backend and html,css, javascript for front end and suddenly he asked what is difference between Java and javascript. Could not figure out at that time.

There was no negative marking. Paper Coding round 21 students were shortlisted from the 1st MCQ round and in this round we were asked to write the codes (function only) of 3 questions in 1 hour time. Q1. You are given a matrix of size MxN and only possible values in the matrix are 0 - representing empty position 1 – representing a fresh apple 2 – representing a rotten apple A rotten apple converts all the fresh apples to rotten ones which are adjacent to it in 1 unit of time. Given an input the matrix and you have to calculate the amount of time in which all the fresh apples become rotten. Also determine whether all fresh apples could be made rotten in finite time or not. (20 marks) Input 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 0 2 1 After 1 time unit, the matrix will be transformed to 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 1 0 0 2 2 After 2 time units the matrix will look like 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 Hence output should be 2 time units. (Definition of adjacent only included the left , right, bottom and upper cell and NOT diagonal cell) Q2. You are given a Binary tree and you need to find out the maximum path sum between any 2 leaf nodes of the binary tree (The maximum path sum may or may not pass through root of tree). To be done in O(n) time (20 marks) Q3. You are given an unsorted array of integers and you need to find out whether there exists a majority element in it. (Majority element is one which appears more than n/2 times in an array of size n). To be done in O(n) time (10 Marks) The result of this round was declared late in the night. Some 7 or 8 students were called for the face to face interview rounds. I was the first one to be called and F2F rounds started at 11.30 PM and ended up in 5 AM in the morning :-p I was lucky to be free around 1.15 AM Face 2 Face Round 1 Q1. I couldn’t complete my Paper coding round question 1 (rotten apples). She (the interviewer) asked me to rectify the problem in it. I did it with the help of MxN extra space for visited[][] matrix. She said do it inplace. I did by modifying the Matrix values to 3 , 4 , etc. Q2. Find 5th from last element in a singly linked list. Firstly I gave a solution which took two traversals. She said to do it in 1 traversal only. I did it by taking two pointers and maintaining a distance of 5 nodes between them. Q3. You are given a string for example if input string is “I am abc xyz”. Output should be the modified string as “xyz abc am I” .This was to be done inplace and in O(n) time. Q4. You are given a unsorted array of both positive and negative integers. You need to find out the maximum sum subarray in O(n) time. You need to find the start and ending indexes along with the sum. Q5. You are given a BST and two keys k1 and k2. You need to find out the lowest common ancestor of the two keys Iteratively. I suggested the solution of storing the path in a vector and finding the 1st mismatch of key value in the root to k1 and root t k2 path. Face to Face round 2 Q1. Take the example of paper coding round rotten apples question and suggest some algorithm where you are allowed to change the position of rotten and fresh apples in such a way that the resultant matrix converts least number of fresh apples to rotten apples. I suggested an approach where I would first count the number of rotten and fresh apples initially and arrange all fresh apples in a sub-matrix starting from (0, 0) position and similarly arrange all rotten apples in sub-matrix from (N-1, M-1) position. He was satisfied with this approach Q2. You are given an elevator system with 3 elevators, you have to suggest some algorithm in which the amount of time that a person waiting on some x floor and has pressed the up or down button should wait for least amount of time and also the person inside the elevator also should not wait for too long to reach his destination floor. Q3. Asked some general questions as to what are tokens of a language. What is a grammar and production rules. Then he asked me to check whether a given code in some language is syntactically correct or not. You are provided the set of valid tokens for this language and also symbol table. Q4. You are given a text file storing characters or words. Suggest some way to compress the file such that there is always some amount of space compression possible. I suggested to use a trie tree as all the prefixes will share the space. He said this approach is dependent on whether the input has common prefixes or not. Suggest some other way. I then said that we can use Huffman Encoding and assign smallest code to most frequent word in the file and so on. He said again this approach also is dependent on whether your input has frequently occurring words or not. Then I suggested that since all characters can be represented in terms of 8 bits or 1 byte. We can take the XOR of prev and next character and store it in the current character position. This way I would be able to always get a n/2 size reduction in the encoded file. The idea was similar to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-linked-list-a-memory-efficient-doubly-linked-list-set-1/ He was satisfied and this was the end of my 2nd F2F round. He told me to get some sleep because you will be having a skype interview with our technical manager followed by HR round in the morning. 3rd round (Skype) Q1. He asked me to define NP and NP hard problems followed by the definition of automata and regular language. He then asked me are regular expressions. Q2. He shared a google doc with me and gave me a regular expression like abab*(a|b) and an input string s. I needed to write a code to check whether the given input string could be generated from this regular expression or not. Return a Boolean true or false value. I coded it up in 5 minutes :-p Q3. You are given a N-ary tree and a value K. You need to return true if there exists some root to leaf path having sum = k and false otherwise. I did it using recursion and in O(n) time. He told me that you’ll be having your final HR round in some time. I knew that I was going well because he seemed to be quite satisfied with my answers. Final HR round That was the round for which I’ve been waiting for hours She (the HR) started off with some general questions like tell me about yourself and your aims and goals in life. What are your hobbies. I told her that I love art and craft. She asked me what will I make for her if tomorrow is her birthday :-p She was very friendly and nice to talk to. It didn’t seem that I was talking to the HR. It was more like talking to a friend. She asked me what I liked about Accolite and why do I wish to join the company and stuff.

Every student got a different set of questions, mine was:\nIt was a very easy and known question of finding the nth term in a Fibonacci series. \nIt was like an encoding question where we have to change every alphabet of a string to an alphabet which is 3 places ahead in alphabetical order. The question was easy having a slight tricky corner case when we encounter alphabets like x, y, and z.\nIt was based on to validate a given IP Address.\nSince the test was so easy so those were able to solve all three questions and having c.g.p.a greater than 9 were promoted to the next round, around 40 students were selected for face-to-face interviews.\n1st Technical Interview(60-90 min): Since due to covid whole process happened virtually so our interviews took place on Microsoft Teams app, mine started at sharp 9 a.m. in the morning, Interview began with a formal introduction about me and my interviewer, then he started discussing my resume, where I have written a lot of things.\nHe started talking about my projects, recently I participated in the Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon, so I have a good project to explain which benefited me a lot. He asked a lot about tech-stack used in developing the project that was React.js for client interface and Django for server interface and python for ML model, he was well impressed with the way I overcome the problems faced during the course of the project, then without wasting more time on projects he shifted to the languages and new technologies that I mentioned my resume like blockchain, this whole conversation lasted for about 20-25 min.\nThen he asked me to code some standard coding questions, He asked me to share my screen and write code on any editor of my choice and language as well, I chose VS Code and c++ language.\nQuestions were quite easy but you have to keep on discussing each and every approach with your interviewer so that he can have a good understanding of what you are writing and to help you as well where you stuck.\nTo find the middle of a singly linked list.\nA program to check if a binary tree is BST or not or  A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not.\nHe has more focus on the time complexity of the programs not on space and told me to optimize my code as much as I could, At the last, he was happy with my optimized approach.\nThen he asked whether I had any questions from him or not and I asked a few questions and my interview ended, I was happy as it went so well.\nI started waiting for 2nd interview call and within 2 hours I got the mail to join the meeting for my 2nd technical interview.\n2nd Technical Interview(45 min): This round started with a good pace, he asked me to first code some problems and given me 3 questions to code, though they were easy he wanted to see my approach to solve these problems, \nTo find the column name from a given column number in Excel sheet \nTo reverse every word of a string without reversing the order of words.\nQuestion-based on Kadane Algorithm.\nAfter going through these questions he said so let's start talking about your projects and resume and started discussion about my projects again in detail, then he asked many questions on Node.js as I have written it as my first priority language for web development. \nQuestions on DBMS, indexing in DBMS, NoSQL, and SQL database, how they both operate on data, and explanations for a large system also.\nAfter getting answers to all these questions he asked some additional questions based on OOPS principles and Operating System basics, I answered them all, he was satisfied with the response.\nThen finally he asked his last question that Do you have any questions and I asked a few about the technologies that interns will be going to work on an internship, about the work culture of Microsoft.\nThis round too went well.\nAt around 6 p.m. I got a call for HR interview (the final round)\nHR Managerial Interview(30 min): This was the most mind relaxing and chill interview, HR used to ask about myself, my hobbies, my family background, and all those stuff. Then one more person joined the meeting I thought one of the head managers of the company he asked me some technical questions like to find the least common ancestor in a binary tree and some technical questions based on my projects I answered them all.\nThen HR wanted me to explain one of my good projects to him, I explained my SIH project to him, and he was happy with that.\nThe interview ended with some questions from my side about the culture at Microsoft.\nNote: At last 22 out of 40 students has been selected for SDE Internship at Microsoft\nSome tips\nBe confident throughout the process and if somehow you got stuck ask for some hints from your interviewer. He will love to help you.\nPractice as much as you can of coding questions from any of the trusted sites, I suggest go for GeeksforGeeks, they have the perfect set of questions for every company\nGo through all the past experiences of the company that you are going to give an interview to (All these stuff are available on GeeksforGeeks)\nAt last prepare with some questions to be asked from the interviewers at the end.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nMicrosoft Interview Experience for Internship""}, {'title': 'Adobe Shecodes Product Interview Experience For Internship 2020', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adobe-shecodes-product-interview-experience-for-internship-2020/', 'content_summary': 'Round 1 (Online Test): The first round was cocubes assessment and below is the test pattern:\nCognitive: 30 Questions, 30 min\nComputer Fundamental: 20 Questions, 20 min\nCoding: 2 Questions, 20min.\nThe cognitive section consists of Aptitude and verbal questions.

I was not able to answer almost all the answers correctly but gave almost 75% correct answers. The interviewer mainly focused on the problem-solving ability and the quality of conceptual knowledge. We were judged on 5 criteria in all the technical Interviews- DSA, Coding, Puzzles, Testing Questions and Operating system. 1: Basic Introductory Questions 2: 2-3 Puzzle Questions which we can easily find on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/ i: You have a birthday cake and have to cut it into 8 equal pieces by making 3 cuts only. How do you do it? ii: You are standing before two doors. One of the paths leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you don’t know who the honest one is and who the liar is.You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question? 3: Some basic Questions on DSA- about stacks, queue, arrays, memory storage accessing, Advantages and Dis of the Linked list over arrays, 4: Operating System: In all the rounds, Operating System questions were asked in abundance. Though the questions were basic, they focused more on our concepts like how easily we were able to explain it to them. Questions on Kernels, Types of Kernel, Why OS, memory allocation in OS were asked. 5: Test Cases Question: We have to think and answer the possible questions while testing the cases. i: Test cases for a login page window. 6: Heavy discussions on the projects I have done. Why we preferred to use a particular technology. What was my role in the project and so on. 7: I was asked to code some questions. i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1 ii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-second-largest-element2406/1 iii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-loop-in-linked-list/1 After a wait of about 15 minutes, I was called for my second round of Interview.  \nFourth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 2\nThis round of interview was taken by a senior person of the company. It was a bit lengthy as we had more of a discussion rather than just a QnA round. The interview went for more than 90 minutes and was tougher than the first round. 1: There was a long discussion on what I have written in my resume. The projects I had done, Extracurricular and co-curricular activities I had written on the resume, the skills I have mentioned. All of it. So be careful of whatever you mention in the resume. 2: Next he asked me a bunch of coding questions which were some very popular ones i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/anagram-1587115620/1 ii: Implementation of Merge Sort https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/ iii: Implementing Queue using stacks and Stack using queues. iv:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-repeated-character4108/1 I was asked to code in my preferred language. So there wasn’t any language barrier and for all the questions the interviewer asked for the most optimized approach. As I was able to answer all the questions, I wasn’t asked any more questions. 3: After the coding questions, I was asked a lot of questions about Operation System and OOPS. i:   Fragmentation- Internal and External ii:  Concepts of Kernel iii:  File Management iv:  Virtual functions and Friend Functions v:  Function Overloading And Overriding vi: What is paging and Demand Paging? 4: Interview puzzles: i: The mislabeled Jar puzzle https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-mislabeled-jars/ ii: Maximize probability of White Ball https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-12-maximize-probability-of-white-ball/ iii:  100 Prisoners with Red/Black Hats https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-13-100-prisoners-with-redblack-hats/ 5:  Testing Based Questions- i: Five new inventions in a glass frame and the test cases to test the working a frame. ii: Design test cases for a shopping application. The interviewer was quite satisfied with the test cases I answered. As the main trick to solve these kinds of interview questions is to design the test cases by giving every small function an eye and then forming all possible scenarios for the same.  \nFifth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 3 + MANAGERIAL ROUND\n  This was also similar to the last two Technical Interviews and was also easier from them. The interview went for about 70 minutes and It was tilted more towards the managerial side and less Technical was asked. 1: Program to Count set bits in an integer. (I answered 4 possible solutions to him and he was satisfied)  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-bits0143/1 2: Working of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort ( I was asked to dry run the solution mainly to check the internal working of swapping and comparison) 3: Torch and Bridge https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/ 4:  Some Mathematical Puzzles 5: Design test cases for OLA Application 6: Design test cases for GMAIL Application 7: Situation based questions 8: What is a Semaphore and operations on a semaphore? 9: What is context switching?  \nSixth Round - HR INTERVIEW\nIt was the last round and an eliminatory round as well.  The interviewer was pretty cool. After the introduction, I was asked questions like where are you from? What is special about you?  Why should we select you? Which was your favorite subject last semester? Which Adobe products you liked the most and why? It was a 20 minutes long discussion round about college life, interests, and hobbies. The HR also asked our preferred joining location between Noida and Bangalore which gave us many hopes of our selection. Three candidates from our college went to the HR Round. Two days later we received the confirmation mail that two students are selected.

Two elements arr[i] and arr[j] form an inversion if arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j.
Inversion Count: For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0.
If an array is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum.
Examples:

There were in a total of 5 rounds. First Round (Online Coding + Aptitude): Firstly don’t expect the online interface to be friendly. There were 3 sections. First section was aptitude which had very very simple questions like addition, subtraction. Second section had a single coding question and the third section had 2 coding questions. All the three coding questions were basic DP and bruteforce. You just had to pass the hidden testcases taking care of the limits. 1. Find the no. of trailing zeros in n factorial. 2. Given an equation Cukoo(n) = Cukoo(n-2)*2 + Cukoo(n-1) -3 (something like this) find Cukoo(n) for a given large input. 3. Don’t remember. Second Round (Technical Interview): The interviewer went through my resume and asked several questions from it. He took one of my projects and had a long discussion over it. Also he asked me to write a few functions that I had used in it. Then he asked me several questions: 1. Given 2 trees, find if one tree is a subtree of other. Write complete code explaining your approach. 2. Given two functions of which one function prints the series of odd numbers (like 1 3 5 7 …) and the other prints the series of even numbers (like 2 4 6 8…). How will you use these two functions to print a consecutive number series i.e., 1 2 3 4 5 6…. I used monitors(semaphores) and he was convinced. Third round (Technical Interview): The interviewer was very friendly. He asked several questions: 1. What is diamond problem? How do you deal with it (both in c++ and java)? Then he discussed about multiple inheritance in c++ and java. 2. Questions on polymorphism, virtual class, etc. What is vptr? Again a long discussion over the properties of classes and objects. 3. Implement strcpy and strcmp functions of C with all the corner cases covered. Fourth round (Technical Interview): 1. What are ACID properties? How are they implemented? How are all the 4 properties taken care of in the real-time applications? 2. What are threads? What is the difference between a thread and a process? 3. Find cycle in a graph. Compare different approaches. He was very particular about the DFS approach. 4. Given a grid representing a maze, find out if there is only a single path to enter the maze and exit. You can view the problem as to check if there are exactly two points on the outer boundary of the grid and there is exactly one path connecting these two points. Fifth round (HR): General questions starting with the traditional “tell me about yourself”.

Note: We are considering that BSTs can not contain duplicate Nodes.
A BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Examples:
Input: root = [2, 1, 3, N, N, N, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The left subtree of every node contains smaller keys and right subtree of every node contains greater keys. Hence, the tree is a BST.
Input: root = [2, N, 7, N, 6, N, 9]
Output: false
Explanation: Since the node to the right of node with key 7 has lesser key value, hence it is not a valid BST.

All they asked at first was about Projects done in my company and at college level. 2. Then main thing they ask was OS and its concepts:      \na. Memory management.      \nb. CPU scheduling.      \nc. Deadlock and its real time examples.      \nd. Questions on how two processes can communicate in OS, give different ways.\n3. Coding questions:      \nReverse a linked list.\nPrint left view of a binary tree.\nImplement your own memcpy. After completion of this round they asked me if I can travel to Hyderabad for further rounds.At 7th January 2017 I gave F2F interview.\nRound-2 F2F:120 minutes\nHe started with simple intro then explained me the position for which interview was going on. 1. Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word \'is\' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find \'is\' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using ""strcmp"" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1. Then he started with questions on OS      \na. Process and thread difference.      \nb. How will you handle 2 thread working on same MAP.Then asked several questions on mutex and different types of locking systems.      \nc. Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation?

The functions should put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers. 2nd Round : - Given an array of size N that contains values in the range [1 N-1], find All missing numbers Do each in O(n). with Working code. HINT : By making it negative. - How to implement LRU caching scheme? What data structures should be used? Was able to answer the LRU cache with discussion, but when i was writing its code, he got confused, told me to give only algo/ steps. Not seems to be convinced. HR told me that review is Good for everything but not that LRU code. I told her Interviewer got confused. So she arranged another round of interview. 3rd Round : Very Nice Guys, Good knowledge give you a lot of confidence. - How will trigger notification at exact time/date.

It consisted of 10 MCQ’s and 3 coding questions. MCQ’s consisted of general aptitude questions, questions related to networking, programming etc and very easy. The coding questions were as follows: 1. http://www.spoj.com/problems/FARIDA/. The question was exactly this. (standard dp problem). (35 marks for this question). 2. Given arrival and departure time of employees in an office. Find the maximum no of chairs needed so that at no instance, an employee has to stand. (30 marks question). Example- Input- 5.00 6.00 7.00 6.30 7.00 8.00 Output-2 It is similar to this. The main thing in this question was reading the input as number of employees was not given beforehand. It was also asked to check for all INVALID inputs and return -1 in those cases. 3. Given a 2D matrix of n x m. The matrix contained integers. Given a source position of a person and a destination position, find the number of ways in which that person can reach destination from source fulfilling the following conditions- (i) Movement can be only in north, south, east or west direction. (ii) A person can move from one cell to other if and only if that cell has value less than the value in current cell. (standard bfs problem). (25 marks question). 2nd round (Technical Interview)- 1.

Example- input [25,1,26,2,27,3,29,28] Ans=5 (subsequence 25,26,27,29,28} I told her a brute force method of O(n^2) and a O(nlogn) solution but she was looking for a O(n) dp solution. This round lasted for about 1 hour. 3rd round (Technical Interview)- 1. Given an array and a frog, there can be a bridge from any index to any index in forward direction and a tunnel from any index to any other index in backward direction. Frog is initially at -1 index. Given an integer k, from can hop at most k-1 times. i.e. if k=4 and frog initially is at -1, then it can reach cell 0,1,2 (3 hops at max). A frog on landing on a cell containing a bridge or a tunnel can avoid using that bridge or tunnel and stay there only. Find the minimum no. of steps in which the frog can reach a given destination ‘D’. I converted the whole problem into a graph where each node will have connections to its next k-1 nodes and also connection to a node to which a bridge or tunnel on that node leads (if any bridge or tunnel is there at that node) and then Applied BFS. He then asked me to write code on paper. Complexity-O(n*k) 2. Given a linked list having loop, detect the loop and return the starting point of that loop. 3. He asked me about what is map (general concept of map not language specific as in c++ or java). He then told me to design a data structure using the basic data structures such that searching in that can be done in O(1) in 95% cases and in 5% cases searching can take more than O(1) and the element to be searched can be an integer or a string. I told him to take hash of string in any way (multiplying by prime nos etc.) and then take modulo 10^6 as maximum size of array can be 10^6. He then asked me how will I remove collisions occurring due to same hash value. I told him to use chaining with a balanced BST at the collision index in order to achieve minimum complexity (o(logn)). He then asked me that if suppose during 1 year only 100 elements were required to be stored in array and searched in above problem and after 1 year elements become 10^6, then during 1 year a lot of memory will be wasted if I allocate 10^6 initially; he asked me how would I do this. I told him that initially allocate memory of array of 100 size and then after 1 year, allocate a new memory of 10^6 elements and copy elements from original array to new array. This round lasted for about 1 hour. 4th round (Managerial Round)- It was a short round of nearly 10-15 minutes. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself. He then asked me why do I want to join Walmart. Why don’t I want to pursue higher studies, difference between job and career and what does I want, job or a career? He then asked me what do I want to achieve in the next 5 Years. He then asked a brief description about the project mentioned in my resume. 5th round (HR Round)- It was also a short round of nearly 5-10 minutes. HR asked me to introduce myself.

Interview process was divided into 4 rounds(including initial Computer based screening round) . All the interview rounds were held virtual.\nRound 1\nIt was the online coding round consisting of 3 questions of Medium Hard difficulty level .\nTest Pattern : \nProblem 1(Easy Medium problem Related to quick sort) : 50 pts, \nProblem 2 : (Hard Level Problem) 75 pts. \nProblem 3 : Similar to Weighted Job Scheduling(Greedy + DP) {https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling/} : 100 pts.\nI did P1 & P3 complete and p2 partial , got selected to further interview rounds.\nRound 2\nIt was a resume screening + DSA round . Initially , a brief introduction was given by them & later , they started with projects listed in my resume . They first asked me to explain about the projects , asked some questions related to its implementation & its actual use case in real world (where it can be used) .Later , they switched to DSA part , a total of 2 questions of easy medium difficulty level were asked . I only remember 1 question that was similar to Minimum platform problem(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-platforms-1587115620/1) .\nAfter this , They asked me for favourite subjects. I said Operation Systems . Then , they asked for some concepts in OS , including CPU scheduling  & its algos like Round robin , SJF etc and later asked which type of scheduling algorithm is used to design actual systems . \n{This round lasted for 45-50 mins}\nRound 3 \nIt was System design round.Though , it also started with a brief introduction & later , asked about projects . As my project was related to test classification . In that context , they asked me to design a low level Suggestion system(In any preferred language) .\nSuggestion System : Given a dictionary of millions of words . Also , a list of words for which suggestions needs to be made as in Google search when we type something its suggestions come from which we can select .For eg : \nInput : Dictionary : [CAT , CATS , CATALOGE , METTLE ,METAL , FITTING]\nList of words :  [CAT , DOG , MET , FIT]\nFor each word in input list suggestions needs to be made & returned .\nOutput : [ [CAT , CATS , CATALOGE] , [] , [METTLE , MET] , [FITTING] ]\nFirstly , i gave a bruteforce approach i.e to check each word in dictionary whether word in list is prefix of that or not. this approach was an O(N * W) time where W is length of word. Later , i suggested a trie based approach in which we can insert all words in dictionary to trie as pre-processing step , and for suggestions , we can query on trie to find all the words with that prefix . As trie is space efficient so they later asked to optimize on time complexity if there are a lot billions of queries which was O(W) where W is total character in suggested list . For that , i suggested to use a hashmap to store results that are obtained previously thus , saved can be used for later queries.\nThis Round lasted for 50-55 mins\nRound 4 (Grad Values & Management Interview Round)\nIt was an hr cum Value based round with Director & Engineering manager . No technical stuff was asked . But , a lot of resume discussion and Atlassian values questions were asked .\nThis Round lasted for 60-65 mins\nThis concludes my interview experience with Atlassian.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of platforms required at the station to ensure that no train is kept waiting.
At any given time, the same platform cannot be used for both the arrival of one train and the departure of another. Therefore, when two trains arrive at the same time, or when one arrives before another departs, additional platforms are required to accommodate both trains.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800], dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three trains during the time 9:40 to 12:00. So we need a minimum of 3 platforms.
Input: arr[] = [900, 1235, 1100], dep[] = [1000, 1240, 1200]
Output: 1
Explanation: All train times are mutually exclusive. So we need only one platform
Input: arr[] = [1000, 935, 1100], dep[] = [1200, 1240, 1130]
Output: 3
Explanation: All 3 trains have to be there from 11:00 to 11:30
Constraints:
1≤ number of trains ≤ 50000
0000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ dep[i] ≤ 2359

"[{'title': 'Vmware Interview Experience Set 9 Internship Rd', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vmware-interview-experience-set-9-internship-rd/', 'content_summary': ""Vmware conducted their online exam via hirepro. Round 1 : There were 3 sections quants, Technical questions and OOPs based questions, no section had negative marks and all questions were MCQs. The quantitative section had 10 questions and we were given 15 minutes, the questions covered all the typical quants topics (like time and work, mixtures & allegations etc.). The questions were hard and were time consuming the trick was to identify the questions you could solve(I could solve only 4). Next there were 23 technical questions, they were easy and medium level, from all topics(OS, CN, Computer Architecture etc.). Then we had a choice before the OOPs section to opt for either Java or C++, I chose java and had to answer 7 tricky questions mostly focusing on inheritance and how constructors work with inheritance. Around 150 students gave the first round from which 42 progressed. Round 2: This was a face to face technical round. I introduced myself and then the interviewer directly jumped onto my projects and asked me to talk about them. I had made an android app which I showed him(I carried my phone) my second project particularly took his attention which was based on Machine Learning I had to explain my project in detail for about 15-20 minutes. He asked me questions on all topics like OOPS, Data Structures, OS, CN. Before beginning he asked me to rate my proficiency in c,c++& JAVA on a scale from 1 to 10. To the best of my memory the questions were: 1) Explain properties of OOPS. (tried to confuse me) 2) Types of constructors. (wanted to hear copy constructor and how it is defined in different ways in c++ and java.) 3) Gave me a typical inherent scenario and asked me how parent class and child class default constructors are called. 4) Asked me to detect& remove loop in a linked list. (I told him I already knew the algo. so we moved on) 5) Asked me to write the expression for height of a complete binary tree. 6) Array to BST (tried to convince me a solution which could give a skewed tree was better) 7) Asked me about different CPU scheduling algo and made me solve a given scenario for wait time and turn around time using different scheduling algos. 8) Asked me about gateway routers and asked me to calculate subnet mask for a given range of IPs. The interviewer tried to pressure me into changing my answers being confident was the key. Round 2 : This was the second technical face to face round. My interviewer was problem-solvingmmediately made me comfortable. After talking about my project in detail, he moved on to problem solving and asked me just 2 questions. 1) Given a sparse 2D matrix (containing 0s and 1s) I had to make all entries of a row and column '1' which had at least one entry as '1'. I gave a O(n^2) solution using hashing he asked me to write down the complete code. 2) In a binary tree find the the level with maximum number of nodes. A typical solution would be Level order traversal but I gave a different solution by connecting all the nodes in a particular level. 6 students cleared the 2nd technical round. Round 3: It was a managerial discussion round, which was basically a telephonic interview with the manager. Other students were asked few technical questions , the interview was more focused on judging your attitude and if you were a good fit for the team. My telephonic interview was mostly about my Machine Learning project, mild business acumen and why I wanted to do an internship at Vmware. Round 4: The final round was the hr round, I was asked about my family background and what would be my reaction if I don't get this internship. Finally all 6 who cleared the technical rounds were selected for a 6 months internship at Vmware, Bangalore. Also we were given vmware bottles :p\nRelated Practice Problems\nMaximum Width of Tree\nRemove loop in Linked List\nHeight of Binary Tree\nArray to BST\nBoolean Matrix Problem\nAll Practice Problems for VMWare !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nVmware Interview Experience | Set 9 (Internship (R&D))""}, {'title': 'Walmart Labs Interview Experience Set 2 On Campus', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/walmart-labs-interview-experience-set-2-on-campus/', 'content_summary': '1st round (Written Test) It was an online test of 90 minutes and was conducted on Hackerearth. It consisted of 10 MCQ’s and 3 coding questions. MCQ’s consisted of general aptitude questions, questions related to networking, programming etc and very easy. The coding questions were as follows: 1. http://www.spoj.com/problems/FARIDA/. The question was exactly this. (standard dp problem). (35 marks for this question). 2. Given arrival and departure time of employees in an office. Find the maximum no of chairs needed so that at no instance, an employee has to stand. (30 marks question). Example- Input- 5.00 6.00 7.00 6.30 7.00 8.00 Output-2 It is similar to this. The main thing in this question was reading the input as number of employees was not given beforehand. It was also asked to check for all INVALID inputs and return -1 in those cases. 3. Given a 2D matrix of n x m. The matrix contained integers. Given a source position of a person and a destination position, find the number of ways in which that person can reach destination from source fulfilling the following conditions- (i) Movement can be only in north, south, east or west direction. (ii) A person can move from one cell to other if and only if that cell has value less than the value in current cell. (standard bfs problem). (25 marks question). 2nd round (Technical Interview)- 1. Given a binary tree, print its bottom view. She asked me to write the code on paper. 2. Given a character array and a dictionary, find the no. of valid sentences that can be made by putting space after any character in this array. A valid sentence is the one whose all the words are present in the dictionary. Write code on paper. Example- Input- catsanddog Output- 2 (cat sand dog & cats and dog) 3. Given an array of random integer, find the maximum length of subsequence in it such that the elements of subsequence are consecutive. Example- input [25,1,26,2,27,3,29,28] Ans=5 (subsequence 25,26,27,29,28} I told her a brute force method of O(n^2) and a O(nlogn) solution but she was looking for a O(n) dp solution. This round lasted for about 1 hour. 3rd round (Technical Interview)- 1. Given an array and a frog, there can be a bridge from any index to any index in forward direction and a tunnel from any index to any other index in backward direction. Frog is initially at -1 index. Given an integer k, from can hop at most k-1 times. i.e. if k=4 and frog initially is at -1, then it can reach cell 0,1,2 (3 hops at max). A frog on landing on a cell containing a bridge or a tunnel can avoid using that bridge or tunnel and stay there only. Find the minimum no. of steps in which the frog can reach a given destination ‘D’. I converted the whole problem into a graph where each node will have connections to its next k-1 nodes and also connection to a node to which a bridge or tunnel on that node leads (if any bridge or tunnel is there at that node) and then Applied BFS. He then asked me to write code on paper. Complexity-O(n*k) 2. Given a linked list having loop, detect the loop and return the starting point of that loop. 3. He asked me about what is map (general concept of map not language specific as in c++ or java).

How do you do it? ii: You are standing before two doors. One of the paths leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you don’t know who the honest one is and who the liar is.You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question? 3: Some basic Questions on DSA- about stacks, queue, arrays, memory storage accessing, Advantages and Dis of the Linked list over arrays, 4: Operating System: In all the rounds, Operating System questions were asked in abundance. Though the questions were basic, they focused more on our concepts like how easily we were able to explain it to them. Questions on Kernels, Types of Kernel, Why OS, memory allocation in OS were asked. 5: Test Cases Question: We have to think and answer the possible questions while testing the cases. i: Test cases for a login page window. 6: Heavy discussions on the projects I have done. Why we preferred to use a particular technology. What was my role in the project and so on. 7: I was asked to code some questions. i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1 ii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-second-largest-element2406/1 iii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-loop-in-linked-list/1 After a wait of about 15 minutes, I was called for my second round of Interview.  \nFourth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 2\nThis round of interview was taken by a senior person of the company. It was a bit lengthy as we had more of a discussion rather than just a QnA round. The interview went for more than 90 minutes and was tougher than the first round. 1: There was a long discussion on what I have written in my resume. The projects I had done, Extracurricular and co-curricular activities I had written on the resume, the skills I have mentioned. All of it. So be careful of whatever you mention in the resume. 2: Next he asked me a bunch of coding questions which were some very popular ones i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/anagram-1587115620/1 ii: Implementation of Merge Sort https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/ iii: Implementing Queue using stacks and Stack using queues. iv:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-repeated-character4108/1 I was asked to code in my preferred language. So there wasn’t any language barrier and for all the questions the interviewer asked for the most optimized approach. As I was able to answer all the questions, I wasn’t asked any more questions. 3: After the coding questions, I was asked a lot of questions about Operation System and OOPS. i:   Fragmentation- Internal and External ii:  Concepts of Kernel iii:  File Management iv:  Virtual functions and Friend Functions v:  Function Overloading And Overriding vi: What is paging and Demand Paging? 4: Interview puzzles: i: The mislabeled Jar puzzle https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-mislabeled-jars/ ii: Maximize probability of White Ball https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-12-maximize-probability-of-white-ball/ iii:  100 Prisoners with Red/Black Hats https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-13-100-prisoners-with-redblack-hats/ 5:  Testing Based Questions- i: Five new inventions in a glass frame and the test cases to test the working a frame. ii: Design test cases for a shopping application. The interviewer was quite satisfied with the test cases I answered. As the main trick to solve these kinds of interview questions is to design the test cases by giving every small function an eye and then forming all possible scenarios for the same.  \nFifth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 3 + MANAGERIAL ROUND\n  This was also similar to the last two Technical Interviews and was also easier from them. The interview went for about 70 minutes and It was tilted more towards the managerial side and less Technical was asked. 1: Program to Count set bits in an integer. (I answered 4 possible solutions to him and he was satisfied)  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-bits0143/1 2: Working of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort ( I was asked to dry run the solution mainly to check the internal working of swapping and comparison) 3: Torch and Bridge https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/ 4:  Some Mathematical Puzzles 5: Design test cases for OLA Application 6: Design test cases for GMAIL Application 7: Situation based questions 8: What is a Semaphore and operations on a semaphore? 9: What is context switching?  \nSixth Round - HR INTERVIEW\nIt was the last round and an eliminatory round as well.  The interviewer was pretty cool. After the introduction, I was asked questions like where are you from? What is special about you?  Why should we select you? Which was your favorite subject last semester? Which Adobe products you liked the most and why? It was a 20 minutes long discussion round about college life, interests, and hobbies. The HR also asked our preferred joining location between Noida and Bangalore which gave us many hopes of our selection. Three candidates from our college went to the HR Round. Two days later we received the confirmation mail that two students are selected.

There were in a total of 5 rounds. First Round (Online Coding + Aptitude): Firstly don’t expect the online interface to be friendly. There were 3 sections. First section was aptitude which had very very simple questions like addition, subtraction. Second section had a single coding question and the third section had 2 coding questions. All the three coding questions were basic DP and bruteforce. You just had to pass the hidden testcases taking care of the limits. 1. Find the no. of trailing zeros in n factorial. 2. Given an equation Cukoo(n) = Cukoo(n-2)*2 + Cukoo(n-1) -3 (something like this) find Cukoo(n) for a given large input. 3. Don’t remember. Second Round (Technical Interview): The interviewer went through my resume and asked several questions from it. He took one of my projects and had a long discussion over it. Also he asked me to write a few functions that I had used in it. Then he asked me several questions: 1. Given 2 trees, find if one tree is a subtree of other. Write complete code explaining your approach. 2. Given two functions of which one function prints the series of odd numbers (like 1 3 5 7 …) and the other prints the series of even numbers (like 2 4 6 8…). How will you use these two functions to print a consecutive number series i.e., 1 2 3 4 5 6…. I used monitors(semaphores) and he was convinced. Third round (Technical Interview): The interviewer was very friendly. He asked several questions: 1. What is diamond problem? How do you deal with it (both in c++ and java)? Then he discussed about multiple inheritance in c++ and java. 2. Questions on polymorphism, virtual class, etc. What is vptr? Again a long discussion over the properties of classes and objects. 3. Implement strcpy and strcmp functions of C with all the corner cases covered. Fourth round (Technical Interview): 1. What are ACID properties? How are they implemented? How are all the 4 properties taken care of in the real-time applications? 2. What are threads? What is the difference between a thread and a process? 3. Find cycle in a graph. Compare different approaches. He was very particular about the DFS approach. 4. Given a grid representing a maze, find out if there is only a single path to enter the maze and exit. You can view the problem as to check if there are exactly two points on the outer boundary of the grid and there is exactly one path connecting these two points. Fifth round (HR): General questions starting with the traditional “tell me about yourself”.

Round 1: It was coding round which is also known as Samsung advanced test. You will be given with one coding question that has to be solved in 3 hours. A total of 50 test cases have to be cleared in order to clear this round. Those who have cleared this test will only be shortlisted for further rounds. If you are unable to clear this round in 3 hours, you will be given another chance i.e. another question that has to solved in 3 hours again. Usually this second attempt would be much straight forward to clear (will be standard repeated question of Samsung). I suggest the aspirants to go through all the coding questions from experiences of Samsung. Coding questions solved by me are:\nAttempt 1: A game like mario, where you have to reach the end point in the minimum distance. Can be solved using shortest path algorithms. Due to complexity of the problem, I was only able to clear 40 out of 50 test cases. Because of which I was asked to take second attempt.\nAttempt 2: Given a graph, find whether a cycle exists. If so, print the cycle in sorted order. It was a easy question and was qualified for further rounds.\nRound 2: It was a techincal interview round. The interview started with discussion on my rojects, questions on operating systems, indepth discussion about pointers and easy problem solving questions. It was pretty easy interview to crack to. Just be confident with basics in order to clear this round. Round 3: It was HR round which was just for formality. Asked to speak about any latest technology and discussion about joining date and formalities. Got the offer in the next week. Verdict: Selected.

The interviewer was very helpful and experienced, he already knew of the common errors a candidate would make and was giving hints and ample time. He asked me about 13-14 questions related to C, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, Pointers in C, etc. Some questions were: implement a stack using a inked list. Given a function with a source pointer, destination pointer and the length in bytes copy the data from the source pointer address to the destination pointer address. In a social network, suggest friends of friends of friends to a user. In a directed graph detect the presence of a cycle etc. 5 candidates made it through the next round.\nTech Interview This round lasted for about 30 mins. This was sort of only a cross check round regarding the projects and the interviewer was looking for someone with a Machine Learning project. He asked whether I think I would be a good fit with Samsung and told some things about the work there. I had a Deep Learning project in my resume and he asked me to explain how it worked, I explained that to him for about 10 mins and he seemed satisfied with my explanation. He then asked me why I wanted to join Samsung and some more general questions. He then told me that I would be going through to the HR interview round and said that he expects that I would make it through. Before the interviewers left they shook hands with the 5 candidates and said that they expected all of us to meet them in the Samsung campus next year.\nHR interview The HR was quite sick and thus didn't come to the college campus. A telephonic interview was held next night for 5 candidates. The interview started with normal greetings. Then he asked me why I didn't do a Summer Internship despite my background into competitive coding(Summer Internship is not mandatory in my college). He then asked me whether I think I would get selected. Then he asked about what I know of the work being done in SRI Bangalore, I mentioned AI, IoT, Data Intelligence etc. He then asked me to explain what AI is, further he asked me to explain how is intelligence added in machines, I mentioned there are algorithms like Regression, Clustering etc. He then asked me to give an overview of what regression is. He then asked me whether I had any questions. I asked a question, he answered and then the interview got over. The interview lasted only 8 mins.\nThe results were declared in the morning and finally, 3 candidates were offered Internship + Jobs.

Some question related to DP Round 2 (Technical) a. First there was a deep discussion on my project. Questions related to Scalability were asked. I was asked to draw the schema of my database and make it more efficient, questions related to normalization were also asked. Long Discussion on NoSQL. b. Top view of Binary tree but i told the interviewer that i know the answer and he seemed impressed with my honesty. Was asked to implement Hashmap in C and one question related to hashmap was asked. There are two hashmaps and we have to find common entries, deleted entries, inserted entries and updated entries in an efficient way. Round 3 (Technical) a. All the questions which i attempted in my coding round were asked to explain. b. This question was asked: First, I gave recursive solution and then the optimized DP Solution. c. Output question on OOPS (Please be thorough with your oops concept as they are very important) d. Detecting the starting of loop in linked list and was asked to explain how it works. e. Given a binary tree, whether it is a BST? Round 4 (Technical) A long discussion on my other projects and then he gave me design question in which he asked me to design a data structure to represent the situation ( You really can't prepare for these types of questions but make sure that you know all the important data structures from linked list to Segmentation Tree) Round 5 (HR) Basic HR Questions were asked.

Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word \'is\' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find \'is\' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using ""strcmp"" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1. Then he started with questions on OS      \na. Process and thread difference.      \nb.

Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation?

There were 4 rounds. Online Round ( 1 Hour ) This round consisted of 20 aptitude questions and 3 coding Questions. Coding Questions: 1. Find ‘x’ in the equation. The input is in the form of a string. Equation consisted of addition operator only and 2 integers and a variable ‘x’. Sample Input Case: x+3=5 output=2 Decoding the string into 2 numbers and an unknown variable took a lot of time. 2. Given two numbers x and y find x^y in log y time. 3. Find the next palindromic number greater than the current number. Had solved all 3 questions and around 15 questions in aptitude. Was shortlisted for the next round. Technical Interview 1 ( 1 Hour 20 mins ) Firstly the interviewer asked me to introduce myself, asked me about my projects. Then he moved on to coding questions and puzzles and some basic object oriented fundamentals: All the questions below were in random order. 1. Questions related to collections, interfaces, JBM, JDE, Polymorphism and Abstraction. 2. Coding question : Full codes to be written a> Given an array comprising of only 1’s and 0’s , find the maximum length along with the starting indexand ending index which consisted equal number of 1’s and 0’s. I could not do it, the interviewer gave me another question: Given an array comprising of any number ( both positive and negative), find the maximum length alongwith starting and ending index which had sum equal to 0. I was able to do this one. The interviewer told me to solve the previous question now. I told him that replace all the 0’s with -1’s and the question becomes entirely the same. b> To Check whether a binary tree is a BST or not? 3. Puzzles: 1. There are 3 switches outside a room. Inside the room there is only 1 bulb. You could go inside the room only once, how will you know with which bulb the switch is associated with. 2. There are 100 coins in a table. 20 coins are heads and others are tails (facing upwards). Find the optimal cut(2 piles) such that both have equal number of heads facing up.Technical Interview 2 ( 1 hr ) Technical Interview 2 ( 1 hr ) Coding Questions: 1. Cloning Linked List with every node comprising of next and (random pointer to any other node). 2. Detect Loop in a Linked List and remove it. 3. In-place reversing of a string.

She first asked me to introduce myself to her We had a long discussion on one of my internships at a startup and what role I played in the product I developed. Then she proceeded to the DSA Questions  1. Convert a series of strings to their integer form I gave multiple solutions like direct functions to do so in java, then she told me to give a solution without the function I gave a hashmap solution with keys as string version of the number and values as integer which was O(1) She further told me remove the hashmap, then I said we could directly extract characters and return ascii values. She was satisfied with all the solutions. 2. Find the pair in Array of integers that sum upto 'x' I gave a naive solution first with O(n^2) then further used sum of subsets and gave a O(2^n) solution I couldn't think of a O(n) solution so quickly. The link of the solution is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKMZXc0jQU (I realised how easy it was after the interview.. Oops!) 3. Detect a cycle in linked list I explained the floyd's algorithm for cycle detection. she was satisfied with the solution https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1 4. She gave me a complex scenario on inheritance (java) and questions on it. It wasn't difficult if you know your basics   I had explained her all the solutions, approach, the code i wrote on the paper and ran through examples for each question asked At last she asked me about my future plans and asked me if I had any questions for her I asked her some questions that I had in mind about her growth in the company.

Your task is to determine if the linked list contains a loop. A loop exists in a linked list if the next pointer of the last node points to any other node in the list (including itself), rather than being null.
Custom Input format:
A head of a singly linked list and a pos (1-based index) which denotes the position of the node to which the last node points to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop.
Examples:
Input: head: 1 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 2
Output: true
Explanation: There exists a loop as last node is connected back to the second node.
Input: head: 1 -> 8 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There exists no loop in given linked list.
Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 1
Output: true
