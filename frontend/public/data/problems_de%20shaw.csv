The given BST has been transformed into a
Max Heap and it's postorder traversal is
1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
Your task :
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function convertToMaxHeapUtil() which takes the root of the tree as input and converts the BST to max heap.
Note : The driver code prints the postorder traversal of the converted BST.
