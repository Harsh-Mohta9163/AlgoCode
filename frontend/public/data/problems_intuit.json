Print a similar pattern given the length of the side of the Rhombus.\nSolution approach: Observe and understand the pattern of numbers.\nQuestion 4\nI do not remember this question correctly but it required some tricky implementation using map and set.\nI completed all the questions.\nInterview 1 (Resume based + Behavioral)\nDate : 4 Aug 2020\nMode : Video call on Zoom\nDuration : 30 minutes\nThe interview started with a brief introduction of the interviewer and myself. We discussed a bit about the current COVID scenario.\nHe asked a few questions related to asymptotic analysis, some basic questions about C, C++ and OOPS. I was then asked to describe a project from my resume. We spent some time discussing the courses I had done. \n Finally I asked some questions about the company and the interview ended smoothly.\nInterview 2 (Tech)\nDate : 6 Aug 2020\nMode : Video call on Zoom, live coding on shared Google Doc\nDuration : 75 minutes\nThere were 2 interviewers this time. The three of us introduced ourselves. One of my projects had the use of high fps cameras in it, which caught the interest of one of the interviewers and she asked me an open-ended question: Design a camera for blind people. I was asked to think of creative ideas irrespective of the implementational complexity.\nAfter this, we proceeded to coding questions.\nQuestion 1\nFolding a linked-list\nSimilar question: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-a-given-linked-list-in-place/\nPractice Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reorder-list/1\nI divided the solution into three functions :\nReverse the second half (non-recursive implementation)\nmerge the first half with the reversed second half\ndriver function\nShe asked me to write a recursive implementation of the Reversal function for linked lists.\nAlongside coding, I was being asked basic things like complexities of each function, data structure associated with recursive function calls, null pointer etc.\nQuestion 2\nDS Design\nThe second interviewer asked me to design a data structure (for the elements of a given array) which supports the following queries :\nfind index of any element in O(1) time\nprint the elements in the same order as the input array in O(n) time.\nArticle Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/\nI implemented it using the map. He additionally asked me to handle duplicate elements, where all the indices at which the given element occurs should be printed. \nI was able to code all questions properly and easily.\nThe interview ended with a light discussion about the company.\nI received the result on same day after a few hours and got selected for the internship.\nMost helpful resources based on my experience: GeeksForGeeks, InterviewBit, Codeforces.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nIntuit Interview Experience for SWE (Summer Internship)"

There were 3 Technical Rounds + 1 HR Round. 1st Round: 1) Write a program to Reverse a number in Java without using builtin methods. 2) Write a program to Reverse a String in Java without using builtin methods. 3) He combined the above questions such that, no matter what we provide string or an integer or a double, the program should reverse it. Basically He was expecting method overloading concept. 4) A puzzle. You will be given with a 3 Litre container & a 7 Litre Container. Measure exactly 5 Litres of water. 5) Reverse a linked list. 6) Asked about one of my projects I mentioned in my resume. 2nd Round: 1) Detailed discussion about all my projects that I mentioned in my resume. 2) Find the common elements from 3 Lists. 3) Some questions on Object Oriented Programming Concepts. 4) Some Questions on Multi-Threading. 5) Asked in detail about 'volatile' variables. 3rd Round: 1) Which protocol is used by telnet? 2) Difference between telnet and ssh 3) What happens when we open a file using one tab and delete it from the other tab of the terminal 4) Some questions from Software development life cylce. 5) Basics about Virtualization & Hyperwisers. 6) Explain Cloud computing in layman's language. (Thanks to Balaji Vishwanthan for an amazing answer for a similar question Quora) HR Round: 1) About my family background. 2) Roles played by me in my various projects 3) Typical HR Questions like, Strengths, weeknesses and Hobbies. After this the HR told that the manager of the team for which they wanted me to select has not come for the interview process that day, so, I will be having one more round with the Manager within couple of days in their office. I waited for 2 weeks and still they havent called. I thought its better to give up. Then one morning the HR called and asked me to come to their office for the interview with the manager. Uff! A relief.. At VMWare Office, before the manager takes the interview, one more person from that team took a technical Interview. They asked me to write the code in Java for the following questions: 1) Given an array with repeated numbers, print the frequencies of each number. 2) There are 3 kinds of balls in a big array. Red, Green, Blue color balls. Arrange them in such a way that all the red balls to the left, Green balls in the middle and Blue balls to the right of the array. 3) Modified the above question such that, the arrangement should be like, [R,G,B,R,G,B,R,G,B]. And discussed various boundary conditions. At last, The interview with the manager: 1) Some questions on Software Development Life Cycle Then it was a casual discussion about what their team does, and what are my roles if I get selected.\nRelated Practice Problems\nReverse a String\nReverse a linked list\nFrequency of Array Elements\nAll Practice Problems for VMWare !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nVMWare Interview Experience | Set 2 (On-Campus)"

Out of 200 students, only 35 qualified for the next round. Round 2: ONLINE CODING ROUND on HIREPRO platform This round consisted of a single coding question to be solved within 60 min. No constraints and test cases were provided. Given a number n, print all primes smaller than n. Given a number x, determine whether the given number is Armstrong number or not. Round 3: GROUP DISCUSSION ROUND This was not the usual GD round. It was new and different. The 35 students were given a case study. It consisted of a conversation between a client and a consultant over an inventory management system. We had to create an object/class model for the client. Out of 35 students, only 25 qualified for the next round. Round 4: TECHNICAL ROUND -1 Q1: Given an API which consisted of three methods, create (), update (), delete () .and two users: X and Y, who can access all the three methods. Both users use the create () and delete () methods in the same way but update () is used by them in different ways. How will you implement this in OOPS? (Use interface or Abstract class) Q2: What is database hierarchy? How to implement hierarchy in database tables? Q3: Question on HTTP 1.1 request and response messages. Q4: Linux questions on find command, top utility Q5: MY project was on Big Data. Hence questions on that. Round 5: TECHNICAL ROUND - 2 Q1: MY project was on Big Data. Hence questions on that. but the questions were deep and tough. Q2: Questions on JAVA (String Buffer class and its methods) Q3: OOPS concepts: POLYMORPHISM in detail Q4: OSI model in detail Q5: Design a stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space . Q6: Reverse a linked list. Round 6: HR ROUND General easy questions asked in HR round. Basically, the company preferred students who had done projects on BIG DATA and CLOUD.

Later he asked me few data structure questions.\nHe asked me to write a program to reverse a linked list. Before i started writing it; he asked me if i knew it, i told yes; so he asked me to explain it without writing it....I explained him with my hands visually and very clearly(guess i impressed him atleast a little with this)\nNext, he asked me to write a working program for all operations in a stack and also asked, What is a stack, its use, etc? (gave a simple definition, its applications and the principle on which it works). I did this all pretty well. Again as usual, when given the chance to ask questions; asked him lots of questions and made sure that i stand out from others.\nThe interview duration was approx 1.5 hours if am right, which was the longest comparing to others in the same panel. Later was through to HR Round directly after this round. HR Round\nIt was again with lots of simple questions and what i would do in various scenarios; and was again given a chance to ask questions; i made sure i make full use of the opportunity and asked around 5-7 questions. (PROPER QUESTIONS about the company...). And i had completed a course in ENGLISH in coursera, and i also was school first in English in CLASS XII; so by seeing these two the HR asked me why i did that course? (considering my english wasn't very bad...maybe it could be better on the vocabulary part, but who cares...?) I told her that i did that course because i wanted to improve my English speaking and writing skills in a professional way; and also told that around 200 students scored the same mark as me in English in CLASS XII, though it was the first mark....(She laughed and told Okay)\nFor every answer i gave some clarity to it...and when i told something negative about myself or something...i backed it up by giving some valid reason for the same... For ex: My weakness was I forget things; I told her i'll overcome this by making use of reminders, alarms, and by taking notes as and when things are told....so that i don't forget things easily....\nThis time I was lucky enough to have got placed in QUALCOMM with FTE + INTERNSHIP OFFER.  \nAll Practice Problems for Qualcomm !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nQualcomm Interview Experience | Set 4 (Intern + Full Time Employee)"

        "content_summary": "It was a very good experience to face interview at Qualcomm (Hyderabad-2016) I have attended the interview for a position of Software Engineer and My experience and Questions are mentioned below. Round-1 Telephonic around (40min to 1hr) Medium level.\nAll about your CV\nLots of questions on project and how it works actually\nOS concepts and real examples\nDeadlock situations (detection ,prevention)\nSw watchdog timers\nOS schedulers and algos\nError handling in the system , Core dumps ,etc\nMemory management concepts\nMutex/critical section/semaphores\nDsp processor, pipeline, and serial IC\n3 Coding questions (LinkedList, stack based, and string based).\nNote: All round questions were asked deeply and need to tell him until he convinced with the answers. After 7 days I got a call to come down to Qcom office for next rounds. That day went from 10 to 4 clock break only for lunch. Round 1 (2 person took from 10 to 12.30):\nStarted with my resume, asked questions on my internship projects, main projects.\nBasics of C programming.\n5 coding questions (bit wise, Fibonacci, LinkedList, trees, and pattern recognition)\nThen started with os concepts, scheduling algorithms, best data structure for real time scheduling. Memory map of program, Storage classes and their mapping\nIf we declare more number of variables than the registers available on the processor? Where they will be stored.\nIPC (signal, as I coded in this) how actually it does transfer of memory\nSet of C code snippets given to debug … Identify problems in it and tell outputs\nMemory questions like Best fit, worst fit, average fit questions. And further questions on that.. like why?\nRound 2 (coding):\nBasic C questions and resume questions\nWrite a program to Delete a node, given only a pointer to the node in a Circular linked list\nHow to access data in the called functions after returning from it (point here is that, cannot access auto variables in functions after it is being called off )\nWrite a program to return a stream of bytes from a function\nLots of questions on Function pointers, how, usage, examples\nThere was an IPL tournament, after every match you have to find the team with max points. You have to tell logic first then code it.\nLinkedList questions print every odd node first followed by even node without changing the LinkedList.\nRound 3 (coding):\nGeneric questions on project they are doing, how market values are there, what products are coming\nCount the occurrence of pattern 011110 in a large binary file.\nQuestions on semaphores and mutex\nQuestions on Call back functions\nQuestions on function pointers\nProgram to Reverse a single linked list\nProgram to Detect loop in a single linked list\nPriorities of OS programs, process and thread differences\nHow to handle the Generic functions, like Void pointers\nSimilar coding question level order spiral form.\nFind the Next Permutation number.\nRetrieve the max 6 file in a folder who's size greater than 1MB.\nRound 4:\nWrite a own program for strstr function, optimal way\nWrite a program to convert a given single Linked list to BST\nQuestions on macros How do you want to see yourself after a year, you intentions, aspirations Big & Little endian – definitions, representations, write it down, swap them, etc\nLots of memory related questions\nWrite a program to implement memcpy() on your own\nNeed to evaluate many other conditions like overlap situations and etc.,\nDifference between library call and a system call\nPriority inversion in a RTOS and its solutions\nRound 5 (Manager): Qualcomm aspirations, culture and how you look to be next, feedback from us on the interview, Nothing much… just a casual talk. Round 5 (Hr): Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation? just a casual talk. Note: All rounds, you need to explain about your project clearly and they can ask some really good questions from your project. Be out and out clear with your projects and CV. After this, I was actually into my Dream Company and Happy..!! I suggest that always listen carefully to an interviewer, they’ll definitely help if you have any doubt. Tell them your approach at least if you are not able to code it. Practice writing code on paper. For Qualcomm Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings and Trees are concepts which are very generally asked. Data structures & algorithms, OS should be proficiently practiced. I would sincerely Thank GeeksforGeeks very helpful in my preparation and hope this would be useful for other aspirants.\nAll Practice Problems for Qualcomm !\nRelated Practice Problems\nSubsequence matching\nImplement strstr\nDetect Loop in linked list\nReverse a linked list\nNext Permutation\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nQualcomm Interview Experience | Set 7 (Off-Campus)"

        "content_summary": "It was really good experience at Qualcomm. I was interviewed for Associate Software Engineer and have an experience of an year, first by telephonic round and then F2F interview.\nRound-1 Telephonic around: 70 minutes (Taken by 2 persons)\n1. All they asked at first was about Projects done in my company and at college level. 2. Then main thing they ask was OS and its concepts:      \na. Memory management.      \nb. CPU scheduling.      \nc. Deadlock and its real time examples.      \nd. Questions on how two processes can communicate in OS, give different ways.\n3. Coding questions:      \nReverse a linked list.\nPrint left view of a binary tree.\nImplement your own memcpy. After completion of this round they asked me if I can travel to Hyderabad for further rounds.At 7th January 2017 I gave F2F interview.\nRound-2 F2F:120 minutes\nHe started with simple intro then explained me the position for which interview was going on. 1. Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word 'is' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find 'is' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using \"strcmp\" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1. Then he started with questions on OS      \na. Process and thread difference.      \nb. How will you handle 2 thread working on same MAP.Then asked several questions on mutex and different types of locking systems.      \nc. Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation? NOTE: One must be clear with pointers and memory management and DS questions. Basics of C is they ask a lot.\nAll Practice Problems for Qualcomm !\nRelated Practice Problems\nReverse a linked list\nLeft View of Binary Tree\nReverse Bits\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nDetect Loop in linked list\nSet Bits\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nQualcomm Interview Experience | Set 8 (Experienced)"

Here’s my interview experience:\nRound 1: (Online MCQs)\nQuestions on aptitude, English, logical reasoning, C/C++ and 5 coding ques. (only pseudo code).\nRound 2: (Online Coding Round)\n1.\nA prisoner broke out from jail. In order to escape, he will have to jump n no. of walls and length of each wall is given. Maximum height to which prisoner can jump is given. Now since it was a rainy day all the walls are wet and when prisoner makes a jump he slips down l units. Calculate total no. of jumps he will have to make in order to escape\n. (Simple logical question) 2.\nFind smallest substring which contains all characters from a given string?\nInput string1: “This is a test string” Input string2: “tist” Output: “t stri” 3.\nGiven a maze. Drop a mouse in the maze randomly, and place a piece of cheese in any cell. The mouse can move 4 directions up down left rightThere are some walls on the way to block certain directions for certain position. Design an algorithm for the mouse to find the cheese.\nNote: the mouse does not know where he is, and where the cheese is. He cannot find x,y for the position he is right now. for instance X X B D X D A X X D is the block with walls on 4 sides. If the mouse reaches the end of row or column, it gets the dead end. Mouse is A, cheese is B. Return true if mouse can reach the cheese else return false. Note: if your code doesn’t compile, they will not accept it even if your logic is correct.\nRound 3: (Technical Interview)\n• A brief intro of yourself and discussion on my projects. • Then he asked me about my fav. subject and language (DS and C++). • Questions on OOPS (almost all the concepts were covered like polymorphism, overriding, overloading, inheritance, concept of virtual fxns etc.) • He wrote a C++ code and asked me to write the output. • Some questions on DS and then he asked me to\nwrite algo for reversing a linked list.\n• Then he asked me to explain one of the questions that I had attempted in the coding round. (They just want to make sure that you know the logic). Round 4: (Technical Interview) • Topics in DS that I am comfortable with and the ones with which I am not. • Unfortunately this time he asked me questions from the later. They don’t want a correct answer but just want to see how you approach in such questions. • Questions from bit-wise operators • Then he asked me to explain other one of the two questions I had attempted in coding round.\nRound 5: (HR Interview)\nA quick intro Discussion on my projects What you know about their company apart from ppt. Make sure you study their website inside-out before you go for interviews, this shows your passion to work for their company. Questions on strengths, weakness and hobbies.

Section B- There were 3 coding questions. 1) Given an array and 2 numbers l,r find the number of elements in the array in between l and r; 2) Calculate a power b (b -> [1,1000000000] (required a logn approach). 3) Let 1 represent ‘A’, 2 represents ‘B’, etc. Given a digit sequence, count the number of possible decodings of the given digit sequence. eg. input - \"121\" output - 3. Round-2 : Technical Round (1 hour 10 minutes). The interviewer was very friendly and was trying to find out how much u can think. 1) Given a rotated array around a pivot element find a number x in the array.(write code in log n time). 2)Given 50 red and 50 blue balls, arrange them in 2 bags in such a way that the probability of taking out a red ball in 1st attempt is strictly > 1/2. 3) reverse a linked list. 4) The concept behind why a sewage lid on a road is round-shaped.Trying to find out how much u can think. (because the lid wont go inside in any way as a circle is uniform 360 degree.Rest any shape can go inside along the diagonal vertically). 5) find the depth of a tree. 6) A cake is on table.Another piece is cut from anywhere in the cake.Using a single cut divide the cake into 2 parts.(cut along the line joining the mid-points of the cake and the piece.) 7) write full working code for printing a matrix in spiral form. 8) Measure 4 litres water using 2 containers of capacity 5 and 3 litres respectively.(infinite supply of water). Round-2 Technical Round (50 minutes). A good 10-minutes discussion on my project. Next I was made to write full code for every question. 1) Iterative preorder traversal. 2) Iterative inorder traversal. 3) Reverse a string wordwise. (Let the input string be “i like this program very much”. The function should change the string to “much very program this like i”). 4) Calculate a^b in logn and find the total number of multiplications.(check binary representation of b and count 1's for the number of multiplications.)

        "content_summary": "I was recently interviewed by OLA, I could not make it after the last round. All rounds I had were telephonic, in the last round I was asked to code on collabedit. Round 1 (around 35 min): 1. Given a matrix containing 0's and 1's. Find all the rows which are having 1's at same position. Give all sets satisfying this. 2. In a stock market given are price of shares spread over a week. On what day should I buy and what day should i sell to get maximum profit. 3. Being a computer engineer why did I not opt for system side programming than web domain. (I had expr in web domain) 4. I had expr in web domain so he asked: What is the difference between web browser request and ajax call request. -- It is simple, by ajax call partial web page can be loaded. 5. Have you worked on ruby on rails? Round 2 : 1. Given a matrix containing numbers. Find the 0's and make all the rows and columns corresponding to that index as 0. 2. Design a structure for a File Uploader service (eg. Dropbox, google drive). It is a service where multiple people can upload data at the same time and it also lists the top five uploaders (who uploaded the maximum number of files). 3. Puzzle: There is an employer and a worker, the employer has a gold bar of 7 units and he has to give 1unit each on a day for 7 days. The employer has a magical knife which doesn't work once it performs two cuts(1 cut divides the bar into two parts) on the bar. How will you cut so that 1 unit on each day can be given to the worker. 4. Print left view of binary tree. Round 3 : 1. He discussed what things they work on Ola. How these things are implemented. Like he mentioned of bar code a product has and catalog kind of thing. 2. I had to explain what project I am working on currently, what is the team size. 3. a)Since I had worked on SQL and databases, so he asked me what data structure will I use to implement a database. --I gave hashmap as a soln (the key is our primary key and other fields we can store in an object which will be value for hashmap) b)Now, If in case you want to find all names starting with a particular word (eg. ram....).How will you do that? -- gave trie structure as soln. c)Now you need to find students whose marks are between a range i.e. between two numbers. How will you do, what data structure will you take in this case? -- a simple solution was that, take binary search tree and do inorder traversal of that (I couldn't answer this, not clicked me) 4. Do you want to ask anything? Round 4 : 1. The server receives a ping every 30 secs. The ping is load avg on the machine at that time. Find 90% percentile of the load average on the machine at any time instant. 2. Find missing number in an AP.\nRelated Practice Problems\nStock buy and sell\nMaximum Difference\nAll Practice Problems for Ola-Cabs !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nOLA Interview Experience | Set 7 (For SDE-1)"

        "content_summary": "Round 1 (Written) \nAround 140 students appeared for the offline test. \n\n\nThere were 20 MCQs that to be done in (30 minutes), questions were from OS,DBMS,Datastructures. \nAfter that coding round was there (paper coding) in which 3 questions were given and we have to attempt any 2 (1 hour) \n\n1. Write your own sqrt() function. the function should return square root if it is a perfect square else return floor(sqrt(x)) \n2. Given an array containing positive and negative integers. you have to find the smallest missing positive number. your code should run in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n3. Given an array of strings, find whether the strings can be chained or not to form a circle. A string x can be put before another string y if last character of x is same as first character of y. \n\nAfter round-1 , 19 people were shortlisted for the interviews. \n\n\n\n\nRound 2 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. Tell me about yourself. Meanwhile he(interviewer) looked into my CV and asked about my projects. \nI have done 3 projects so he started discussion CUDA and parallel programming and how you implemented over images to detect edges and how much gain factor achieved. \nsecondly,I have made an project on online voting system so he asked me to draw E-R diagram, schemas and the relationship between them and their functionalities.About (25-30) minutes discussion. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth smallest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n\n3. Suppose you have server where multiple requests are coming at time to,t1,t2...Now suppose a user hits at any particular time t on the server then server should return the last request. you have to design the datastructure for the same. \nI suggested that we can use stack that will return the last request, he then asked me to do for last 10 requests then I suggested to use array of structures which will store request no. and timestamp along with them.Now at any time t we can move 10 elements back but he said that suppose user hits frequently then every time i will have to traverse back again and again so time complexity will be much high, I agreed and suggested another solution similar to LRU implementation so that the requests which are coming frequently can be processed faster. then he modified question that user wants requests of last 1 minute and he gave a hint that is it necessary to store all requests can we not just store requests of every 1 min only,then suddenly it clicked to me, I suggested to use deque for 60 secs now suppose request arrives at 61st sec then we can just add that at rear and remove one from front maintaining a window of 60 seconds.He was satisfied but he want that no deletion should be there so I told him to use circular deque so that we can replace previous elements.He was completely satisfied now with the approach.(About 35 min. discussion) \n\n4. Given an array containing prices of a share of 30 days.A person has 1 share which he can buy and sell any number of times, you have to find the maximum profit which can be earned. \nI suggested one approach to create two auxiliary array MIN from left and MAX from right and traverse both simultaneously if difference between MAX[i] and MIN[i] is greater than maxDiff then update maxDIff and store current index and add to sum if index+1 is not equal to current iteration index and finally return sum.He tried some test cases over my code and found that for some cases it was giving wrong answer,then he asked me that how is my command over dynamic programming,I told I know only the standard ones and no other experience,then he said this question is of DP but he was happy to see my approach.(About 20-25 min.) \n\n\n\n\nRound 3 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. She(interviewer) asked me if I attempted 3rd question in written test, I said I attempted only 1st and 2nd, then she gave me paper and told to implement the 3rd question. \nI suggested an approach to use two arrays of structures(for first characters and last characters) which will contain boolean value to mark presence of character in string and also its index. Now compare two arrays and see that if both arrays have same boolean value and different indices for all first and last characters. If so then strings can form a chain else not.She was in doubt for my solution so she found a testcase where my code was giving wrong answer,so she told me to look for another solution,I came up with another approach and told her that we can make a directed graph from first and last characters and then traverse it in DFS, now suppose if the visited node is visited again and count of total visited nodes is same as total nodes then we can say that strings will form a chain, now she was satisfied with approach and asked me to write code, now as my graph was weak i was in shock,so she said to just write the pseudocode. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth largest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nI suggested to declare a static variable count which will increment count if node visited in inorder and if count becomes k, I will print that node's data and return. Then she asked me how static works and difference between global and static. \n\n3. Given a mobile keypad of say nokia phone and a dictionary which has all the meaningful words which can be formed, suppose now user types some number(input) then your program must suggest all the meaningful words which are present in dictionary.Before implementing this she asked me the datastructure to store the dictionary efficiently and then how will you use this datastructure to make code. \nAt first, I suggested I will store dictionary in 2-D array and lexicograpphically sort it, now suppose user types a number the string starting with that character is searched in the array. she said to reduce complexity because dictionary may contain 1000s of words,then I suggested to use trie datastructure to store and search the string, she was satisfied now and asked me to explain the concept. \n4.Given preorder and postorder of a graph, how can you construct the graph. \nAs I heard this question, i was stuck for 2 minutes but then I said as far as graph is concerned I dont know about it but a unique tree cannot be constructed with preorder and postorder so as graph,so inorder is needed, she was happy and agreed on answer. \n\n\n\n\nRound 4 (Technical) (2:30 hr) \n1. Suppose a linked list is given and there is a loop, you have to find orphan nodes in O(n) time. orphan nodes are the nodes outside the loop. \n\n2. Design a BRTS traffic signalling system such that no two vehicle clashes. Note that BRTS bus will follow the BRTS traffic lights B1,B2,B3,B4 in 4 directions and regular traffic will follow regular traffic lights R1,R2,R3,R4 only. In input only maximum cycle time was given(time after which the process repeates) check for all corner cases (traffic lights have two states only (RED and GREEN)).you have to tell any one possible combination of traffic lights under maximum cycle time. (About 1hr discussion). \n\n3. Suppose a linked list is given but we dont know the count of nodes, you have to find the kth node from last without counting the nodes. \n4. Given an array of n integers such some elements are in the range 0 to n-1 and some out of range may be negative.You have to rearrange array such that all elements which are in range appear on their index and rest appear in sorted manner for indexes not present.This should be done in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nEg- suppose n=6 ,4 5 2 3 6 -3 output= -3,6,2,3,4,5 \n\n5. How can you implement stack using queue/queues. \n6. How can you sort the elements with the help of queue. \nI suggested one O(n) time solution along with O(n) extra space.He asked to do in O(1) space so I suggested deque, he seemed satisfied. \n\nonly 4 were selected till this round (I was one of them) \n\nRound 5 (Bar Raiser) (30 minutes) \n\n1. find the length of longest palindrome in a string starting from index 0. \n2. find if a string A is present in string B or not. \n3. find the length of longest prefix in a string \n\nAfter this 2 were selected finally and unfortunately I was not amongst them as they might have thought i was little stress out. At last I would suggest that your approach and concepts must be strong as they always give questions with some variations. \n\nRelated Practice ProblemsSmallest Positive missing numberCount SquaresCircle of stringsCheck for subsequenceStock buy and sellLongest Palindrome in a String\n\n \n\n\nAll Practice Problems for Accolite ! \n\n\n \n \nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nAccolite Interview Experience | Set 4 (On-Campus)"

        "content_summary": "Recently makemytrip visited our Campus and I got selected in recruitment drive.The placement drive consisted of 4 rounds. Round1: MCQ and coding round It was an online test of 60 minutes consisting of 20 aptitude question and 3 coding question. Platform used for the test was of makemytrip and slightly difficult to understand. Question1: Calculate the power of a ^ b mod c using logn approach.The thing that was to be taken care of was that you did not needed to return or print your answer but you had to store it in their predefined global variable. You could easily find the solution on geeksforgeeks site. Question2: Given a sentence you were supposed to calculate the count of Capital , small letter and number.Question seemed to be quite easy but the pick was that you needed to store the answer in char* output variable in the form of c1:c2:c3 where c1 represent count of capital letter c2 represent count of small letter and c3 represent count of number. (Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,\"%d:%d:%d\",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities . Determine the maximum number of non conflicting activities that you can achieve. (Hint : make a structure of start and finish time and sort according to finishing interval) I solved 2 completely and 1 partially Tip:Since they have only one sample test case so even you are not able to solve the coding question just store the hard coded answer in that variable. I did that in last :P) Out of 110 students 30 students got selected for Personal Interview round. Round 2: Personal Interview Since I was last candidate in that list waiting from 10:30 am My turn came at 10:30 PM.The interviewer was very cool and friendly.He started with asking tell me about yourself and what projects I have done.After half hour rigerous discussion over my project and making schema of databases I used in project He started asking question on ds. Question1: Sort a linklist consisting of 0,1,2's. (Hint: I used hashmap of stl in c++ to store the count of 0,1 and 2) Question 2: Given a stock You need to find the maximum profit you can earn .You are allowed to buy and sell as many number of time you can.) Question 3:Design a treeset in java. (Hint:I told him to use BST but he told to think of more optimized way so Ii told AVL and wrote functions for insertion in AVL tree) Question4:Diffrentiate between method overloading and method overriding.What are static blocks in java. Question5: Drilling question on deployment descriptor,struts,mysql. Round3: Personal Interview The interviewer seemed to be exhausted . He asked me that Since you are the last person so all the question you would have asked. So tell me what all question you have asked. I told him distinct palindromic substring in string, LIS, LCS etc students told that you are asking.He thought for a while and told me to write standard bfs code for graph traversal. Question2: You have been given a matrix of character and a dictionary.You need to find the valid words that you can obtain from it and print it. (Hint:I used dfs to find the valid sequence and assumed that all words are stored in a hashmap) After these He asked 6 puzzles to be solved in a given time. Puzzle 1 : 1.5 hen give 1.5 egg in 1.5 day. How many hens are required to have 4 dozen of egg in 6 days. Puzzle 2: 2 ropes and take 1hr to burn. Calculate 45 min Puzzle 3:10 jar with 10gm marble in each jar.One jar contain 9gm marbles only.Find the defective jar in one turn. Puzzle4:150 person are standing in a queue in sorted order.A blind person comes and wants to be at right position in queue.So he asks any person whether he can stand in front of him.He will reply in Yes or No . You have to find the right place after 2Yes. Give a strategy to find the correct place. (Hint:This puzzle can be reduced to egg drop puzzle) Puzzle 5:25 horse having race find top 3 Puzzle 6:A person is riding a car and he sees a milestone A. After 1hr he sees milestone B which has digits reversed of A.After one hour more he finds a milestone C which contains all the digits of A and B . Given that A < B < C find the speed of car. (Other question that were asked from my friend 1.Distinct Palindrome in string 2.Transaction minimize problem 3.LCS and LIS (dp approach) 4.Diameter of tree 5.Pattern Matching Algorithm (KMP)) HR round: He asked me about my family background,what I do ,hobbies.What I know about makemytrip.What location I would prefer , whether I am satisfied with package or not,Working environment etc, It lasted for half hour.

Ex:- [2,4,6,6,4,2,10], for this the answer is 4, i.e. [2,4,6,6,4,2],[4,6,6,4,2,10],[4,6,6,4],[6,6]. Asked me to write code, firstly I tried doing it by brute then it came to be O(n3) solution and was unable to efficiency.\nThen he asked me what's a Trie Node, deleting and adding strings in trienode and I explained it to him\nAsked about my project and that's it I cleared first round\nI was the only one sent to the 2nd round\nFirstly, he asked me to briefly introduce about myself and then asked why am I trying an IT company when I'm a civil engineering student and then I explained to him about why and all things... There were three questions:\nGiven a nxm matrix filled with all 0s and 1s, find the biggest subsquare which has all 1s in it. Done it using Dynamic Programming\nReverse a linked list in a group. Ex: 1→2→3→4→5→6→NULL with k=3 then the output must be 3→2→1→6→5→4→NULL.\nThe tough question for me and the reason I couldn't get selected (I think that's the reason) Given an array with numbers in it, you will have n number of queries, each query will have 3 inputs x, y, val where x and y represents the start and end indices of a subarray whose all elements must be increased by a value 'val' and then there would be n queries again where each query will have x and y where each query must be returned with the sum of the subarray [x index to y index] of the updated array. At first glance, everyone would say that just add every time a query has been sent but then there would be no point of asking. So, I said I would use union and intersection of the indices and somehow get to the answer and so he asked how to find union and intersection and that's where I toppled and couldn't answer and that's it they said ok and I left. After an hour, the results came and they didn't select anyone from IT profile\nAll Practice Problems for Paytm !\nRelated Practice Problems\nMove all zeroes to end of array\nReverse a Linked List in groups of given size.\nArray of alternate +ve and -ve no.s\nStickler Thief\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nPaytm Interview Experience | Set 9"

Search in a Rotated Array 4.Value equal to index value finally something new.. 5. given a sorted array say A : (-4,-2,0,1,4,6,8,10). There is a function f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c , apply this function on A where x is any ith element from array A and a,b,c belongs to set of real numbers. Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon. I said Java, Spring MVC for backend and html,css, javascript for front end and suddenly he asked what is difference between Java and javascript. Could not figure out at that time. Javascript is also an object oriented language an can be used at server side like node js.

Round 1\nGiven an array of sorted integers, with many of them repeating, and an element x, find the number of occurrences of x. Expected time complexity O(lgn)\nYou have a certain amount of money X, which, if you invest in a bank, gets split into these denominations every year – X/2, X/3, X/4. After every year, you are allowed to withdraw any denomination and any number of these three (including all of them. If you withdraw all of it the total money you’ll have is x/2 + x/3 + x/4, where x is the money in the bank at the time of withdrawing). Say you withdraw X/2, the money left in the bank x = X/3 + X/4. Now for the next year, this x gets split into x/2, x/3, x/4. And so on. Find the maximum profit you can make.\nGiven two words and a dictionary, find the minimum number of changes to be made to the first word so as to form the second word, if you are only allowed to make one change at a time. For example: Word1 = CAT Word 2 = FAR. Words in the dictionary are = { ACT, CAN, CAR, FAT, FAN, FAR }. Answer: min number of transformations is 2. CAT -> CAR -> FAR (or CAT -> FAT -> FAR). Hint: think shortest paths in a graph\nRound 2\nGiven an array of n digits (from 0 to 9), and an integer k, find the maximum number that can be formed by the array if you are allowed k swaps between adjacent elements.\nSearch for a given element x in a sorted and rotated array\nDiscussion on projects and work experience\nRound 3\nNuts and Bolts problem.

After page expires it behaves as free space and can be used for new pages/replacement. Had a long discussion on everything. Round II very boring round 1. Nodes at given distance in binary tree 2.Check Mirror in N-ary tree 3. Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray Round III very boring round 1.Level order traversal Line by Line 2. ZigZag traversal of tree 3. Search in a Rotated Array 4.Value equal to index value finally something new.. 5. given a sorted array say A : (-4,-2,0,1,4,6,8,10). There is a function f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c , apply this function on A where x is any ith element from array A and a,b,c belongs to set of real numbers. Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon. I said Java, Spring MVC for backend and html,css, javascript for front end and suddenly he asked what is difference between Java and javascript. Could not figure out at that time. Javascript is also an object oriented language an can be used at server side like node js. Still there are lot of differences.\n  Related Practice Problems\nTwo Mirror Trees\nLevel order traversal Line by Line\nNodes at given distance in binary tree\nLRU Cache\nSearch in a Rotated Array\nLevel order traversal in spiral form\nKadane's Algorithm\nAll Practice Problems for Hike !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nHike Interview Experience | Set 5"

The level of questions was actually easy, and most were selected only if they could answer all of the 3 right ! \n\nQ1) N-1 elements in an array from 1 to n, find the missing one! \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1\n\nI answered it easily so he added the constrain of over flowing numbers, which took me a little while but I got it \n\nQ2) K distance sort \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nearly-sorted-algorithm/0\n\nHe had clearly stated me that this can be done using normal sorting algo in O(nlogn), but I had to give a more optimized one. \n\nI proposed a solution using a stack, which some how worked for the test case that he gave me, but he proved it wrong and gave me a hint to use another data structure, I got the hint and realised it  was to be done using min heap. Time complexity of which was O(nlogk) ! \n\nQ3)Circular tour \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/circular-tour/1\n\n For this question i gave him a more optimized solution than brute force but with the same complexity, but he did not give me much time for this question as they were running late on schedule. \n\nLater I got to know from sources that I was rated 3.7 out of 5 in this round, which was more than a lot of others. \n\nRound 3: TECHNICAL   II \n\n17 out of 22 made it to this round. \n\nIn this round the questions asked were tough, but the interviewer was very suggestive and kept dropping hints. \n\nQ1)Sum of minimum elements of all sub arrays. \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-minimum-elements-of-all-subarrays/ \n\nI gave an immediate solution in nlogn time, but he asked me to optimize it. He gave me hell a lot of hints but I could not solve this easy question. He then said that they are running out of time so let's move to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ2)Cut off trees for golf \n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/ \n\nAfter a little bit of pickering I was able to give him a solution in O(r^2c^2), but he did not ask me to improve it. He asked me to write the code for it and tell me what algo was I using. I did write a rough algo just enough to give him a clear idea of what was I thinking and he was satisfied with that ! \nAnd we moved on to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ3) LRU cache implementation using array, stack/queue, doubly linked list, circular linked list, Hash map. \nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1\n\nI did them all very easily, and I also told him the story why was I good at it. He was happy enough to let me go again stating that time was a constrain and they had to take further interviews too ! \n\n  \n\nRound 4: HIRING MANAGER ROUND \n\nI was pretty confident that if I make it till here, I will get the job too, which is what happened. \nI entered the room, He asked me \"How was I \" and I told him\" I was hungry\"......that did set the tone of the interview to a casual talk and made him comfortable with me. 5-10 mins into the interview, he commented that I was very honest. ANd so went on the conversation and the usual interview Questions. \n\nWhere do you see yourselves in 5 years? \n\nWhat is your strength and weakness? To which I answered as hard working, being both my weakness and strength and justified it . \n\nHe asked me about my story if JEE and getting into this college. \n\nHow did I grow technically and personality wise in the last 3 years? \n\nand usual questions like that ....to which I gave pretty interesting answers ! \n\nWe then discussed a little about any one of my projects of my choice and I some how led that discussion to about how every college group project is like one person doing the entire work, to him I also told that in one of the projects I did the entire work  and everyone got the credit, and how once in second year my partner did the entire project and I got pointers for it too. He was convinced that I was very honest and true !! \n\nAt last he asked me if I had any questions for him . \n\nI asked him only one question, which was that just in case if I get selected for this job at flipkart or even if I do not, what is that one thing that I should improve or learn about my technical part or my personality part. He did not say anything about my technical skills, He only said that he got a picture that I was not passionate enough . I also joined hands and agreed on it and gave a little justification on it. He also said that  I should not take that personally and that he only siad that because I asked so. \n\nThat is where the HM round ended. I got up, we shook hands and he said that mine was the best HM interview he had in the entire day(my was 2nd last interview of the day), and that he had an interesting conversation with me and truly enjoyed it ! \n\n  \n\nI was on Cloud 7 at the end of this interview. \n\nNext day the results were announced. Out of the 12 who appeared for the HM round. Only one candidate was rejected. 9 people (inclusive of me) we awarded  6 month internship + Full time job after that. 2 were awarded a 6 month internship and they would then evaluate their performance and see if they should hire them for full time or not ! Only one guy who made it to the HM round did not get an offer ! \n\n  \n\n \n \nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nFlipkart Interview Experience for SDE-1"

Print a similar pattern given the length of the side of the Rhombus.\nSolution approach: Observe and understand the pattern of numbers.\nQuestion 4\nI do not remember this question correctly but it required some tricky implementation using map and set.\nI completed all the questions.\nInterview 1 (Resume based + Behavioral)\nDate : 4 Aug 2020\nMode : Video call on Zoom\nDuration : 30 minutes\nThe interview started with a brief introduction of the interviewer and myself. We discussed a bit about the current COVID scenario.\nHe asked a few questions related to asymptotic analysis, some basic questions about C, C++ and OOPS. I was then asked to describe a project from my resume. We spent some time discussing the courses I had done. \n Finally I asked some questions about the company and the interview ended smoothly.\nInterview 2 (Tech)\nDate : 6 Aug 2020\nMode : Video call on Zoom, live coding on shared Google Doc\nDuration : 75 minutes\nThere were 2 interviewers this time. The three of us introduced ourselves. One of my projects had the use of high fps cameras in it, which caught the interest of one of the interviewers and she asked me an open-ended question: Design a camera for blind people. I was asked to think of creative ideas irrespective of the implementational complexity.\nAfter this, we proceeded to coding questions.\nQuestion 1\nFolding a linked-list\nSimilar question: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-a-given-linked-list-in-place/\nPractice Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reorder-list/1\nI divided the solution into three functions :\nReverse the second half (non-recursive implementation)\nmerge the first half with the reversed second half\ndriver function\nShe asked me to write a recursive implementation of the Reversal function for linked lists.\nAlongside coding, I was being asked basic things like complexities of each function, data structure associated with recursive function calls, null pointer etc.\nQuestion 2\nDS Design\nThe second interviewer asked me to design a data structure (for the elements of a given array) which supports the following queries :\nfind index of any element in O(1) time\nprint the elements in the same order as the input array in O(n) time.\nArticle Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/\nI implemented it using the map. He additionally asked me to handle duplicate elements, where all the indices at which the given element occurs should be printed. \nI was able to code all questions properly and easily.\nThe interview ended with a light discussion about the company.\nI received the result on same day after a few hours and got selected for the internship.\nMost helpful resources based on my experience: GeeksForGeeks, InterviewBit, Codeforces.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nIntuit Interview Experience for SWE (Summer Internship)"

There were totally 32 Questions divided into 3 categories with no negative marking. 1) Aptitude & Logical Questions (10 Questions) 2) Computer Science Questions (15 Questions) [C, OS, Data Structures, Microprocessors, Unix] 3) Questions on Java or C++ [We had to choose between Java & C++](7 Questions mainly on OOP Concepts) They Shortlisted 22 people from 200+ people. There were 3 Technical Rounds + 1 HR Round. 1st Round: 1) Write a program to Reverse a number in Java without using builtin methods. 2) Write a program to Reverse a String in Java without using builtin methods. 3) He combined the above questions such that, no matter what we provide string or an integer or a double, the program should reverse it. Basically He was expecting method overloading concept. 4) A puzzle. You will be given with a 3 Litre container & a 7 Litre Container. Measure exactly 5 Litres of water. 5) Reverse a linked list. 6) Asked about one of my projects I mentioned in my resume. 2nd Round: 1) Detailed discussion about all my projects that I mentioned in my resume. 2) Find the common elements from 3 Lists. 3) Some questions on Object Oriented Programming Concepts. 4) Some Questions on Multi-Threading. 5) Asked in detail about 'volatile' variables. 3rd Round: 1) Which protocol is used by telnet? 2) Difference between telnet and ssh 3) What happens when we open a file using one tab and delete it from the other tab of the terminal 4) Some questions from Software development life cylce. 5) Basics about Virtualization & Hyperwisers. 6) Explain Cloud computing in layman's language. (Thanks to Balaji Vishwanthan for an amazing answer for a similar question Quora) HR Round: 1) About my family background. 2) Roles played by me in my various projects 3) Typical HR Questions like, Strengths, weeknesses and Hobbies. After this the HR told that the manager of the team for which they wanted me to select has not come for the interview process that day, so, I will be having one more round with the Manager within couple of days in their office. I waited for 2 weeks and still they havent called. I thought its better to give up. Then one morning the HR called and asked me to come to their office for the interview with the manager. Uff! A relief.. At VMWare Office, before the manager takes the interview, one more person from that team took a technical Interview. They asked me to write the code in Java for the following questions: 1) Given an array with repeated numbers, print the frequencies of each number. 2) There are 3 kinds of balls in a big array. Red, Green, Blue color balls. Arrange them in such a way that all the red balls to the left, Green balls in the middle and Blue balls to the right of the array. 3) Modified the above question such that, the arrangement should be like, [R,G,B,R,G,B,R,G,B]. And discussed various boundary conditions. At last, The interview with the manager: 1) Some questions on Software Development Life Cycle Then it was a casual discussion about what their team does, and what are my roles if I get selected.\nRelated Practice Problems\nReverse a String\nReverse a linked list\nFrequency of Array Elements\nAll Practice Problems for VMWare !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nVMWare Interview Experience | Set 2 (On-Campus)"

Then there was a technical round which consisted of 50 objective questions (comprised mostly C++ output basically on operator precedence, OS concepts, DBMS, and networking) to be solved within 60 min with no negative marking. Out of 200 students, only 35 qualified for the next round. Round 2: ONLINE CODING ROUND on HIREPRO platform This round consisted of a single coding question to be solved within 60 min. No constraints and test cases were provided. Given a number n, print all primes smaller than n. Given a number x, determine whether the given number is Armstrong number or not. Round 3: GROUP DISCUSSION ROUND This was not the usual GD round. It was new and different. The 35 students were given a case study. It consisted of a conversation between a client and a consultant over an inventory management system. We had to create an object/class model for the client. Out of 35 students, only 25 qualified for the next round. Round 4: TECHNICAL ROUND -1 Q1: Given an API which consisted of three methods, create (), update (), delete () .and two users: X and Y, who can access all the three methods. Both users use the create () and delete () methods in the same way but update () is used by them in different ways. How will you implement this in OOPS? (Use interface or Abstract class) Q2: What is database hierarchy? How to implement hierarchy in database tables? Q3: Question on HTTP 1.1 request and response messages. Q4: Linux questions on find command, top utility Q5: MY project was on Big Data. Hence questions on that. Round 5: TECHNICAL ROUND - 2 Q1: MY project was on Big Data. Hence questions on that. but the questions were deep and tough. Q2: Questions on JAVA (String Buffer class and its methods) Q3: OOPS concepts: POLYMORPHISM in detail Q4: OSI model in detail Q5: Design a stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space . Q6: Reverse a linked list. Round 6: HR ROUND General easy questions asked in HR round. Basically, the company preferred students who had done projects on BIG DATA and CLOUD.

Later he asked me few data structure questions.\nHe asked me to write a program to reverse a linked list. Before i started writing it; he asked me if i knew it, i told yes; so he asked me to explain it without writing it....I explained him with my hands visually and very clearly(guess i impressed him atleast a little with this)\nNext, he asked me to write a working program for all operations in a stack and also asked, What is a stack, its use, etc? (gave a simple definition, its applications and the principle on which it works). I did this all pretty well. Again as usual, when given the chance to ask questions; asked him lots of questions and made sure that i stand out from others.\nThe interview duration was approx 1.5 hours if am right, which was the longest comparing to others in the same panel. Later was through to HR Round directly after this round. HR Round\nIt was again with lots of simple questions and what i would do in various scenarios; and was again given a chance to ask questions; i made sure i make full use of the opportunity and asked around 5-7 questions. (PROPER QUESTIONS about the company...). And i had completed a course in ENGLISH in coursera, and i also was school first in English in CLASS XII; so by seeing these two the HR asked me why i did that course? (considering my english wasn't very bad...maybe it could be better on the vocabulary part, but who cares...?) I told her that i did that course because i wanted to improve my English speaking and writing skills in a professional way; and also told that around 200 students scored the same mark as me in English in CLASS XII, though it was the first mark....(She laughed and told Okay)\nFor every answer i gave some clarity to it...and when i told something negative about myself or something...i backed it up by giving some valid reason for the same... For ex: My weakness was I forget things; I told her i'll overcome this by making use of reminders, alarms, and by taking notes as and when things are told....so that i don't forget things easily....\nThis time I was lucky enough to have got placed in QUALCOMM with FTE + INTERNSHIP OFFER.  \nAll Practice Problems for Qualcomm !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nQualcomm Interview Experience | Set 4 (Intern + Full Time Employee)"

Round-1 Telephonic around (40min to 1hr) Medium level.\nAll about your CV\nLots of questions on project and how it works actually\nOS concepts and real examples\nDeadlock situations (detection ,prevention)\nSw watchdog timers\nOS schedulers and algos\nError handling in the system , Core dumps ,etc\nMemory management concepts\nMutex/critical section/semaphores\nDsp processor, pipeline, and serial IC\n3 Coding questions (LinkedList, stack based, and string based).\nNote: All round questions were asked deeply and need to tell him until he convinced with the answers. After 7 days I got a call to come down to Qcom office for next rounds. That day went from 10 to 4 clock break only for lunch. Round 1 (2 person took from 10 to 12.30):\nStarted with my resume, asked questions on my internship projects, main projects.\nBasics of C programming.\n5 coding questions (bit wise, Fibonacci, LinkedList, trees, and pattern recognition)\nThen started with os concepts, scheduling algorithms, best data structure for real time scheduling. Memory map of program, Storage classes and their mapping\nIf we declare more number of variables than the registers available on the processor? Where they will be stored.\nIPC (signal, as I coded in this) how actually it does transfer of memory\nSet of C code snippets given to debug … Identify problems in it and tell outputs\nMemory questions like Best fit, worst fit, average fit questions. And further questions on that.. like why?\nRound 2 (coding):\nBasic C questions and resume questions\nWrite a program to Delete a node, given only a pointer to the node in a Circular linked list\nHow to access data in the called functions after returning from it (point here is that, cannot access auto variables in functions after it is being called off )\nWrite a program to return a stream of bytes from a function\nLots of questions on Function pointers, how, usage, examples\nThere was an IPL tournament, after every match you have to find the team with max points. You have to tell logic first then code it.\nLinkedList questions print every odd node first followed by even node without changing the LinkedList.\nRound 3 (coding):\nGeneric questions on project they are doing, how market values are there, what products are coming\nCount the occurrence of pattern 011110 in a large binary file.\nQuestions on semaphores and mutex\nQuestions on Call back functions\nQuestions on function pointers\nProgram to Reverse a single linked list\nProgram to Detect loop in a single linked list\nPriorities of OS programs, process and thread differences\nHow to handle the Generic functions, like Void pointers\nSimilar coding question level order spiral form.\nFind the Next Permutation number.\nRetrieve the max 6 file in a folder who's size greater than 1MB.\nRound 4:\nWrite a own program for strstr function, optimal way\nWrite a program to convert a given single Linked list to BST\nQuestions on macros How do you want to see yourself after a year, you intentions, aspirations Big & Little endian – definitions, representations, write it down, swap them, etc\nLots of memory related questions\nWrite a program to implement memcpy() on your own\nNeed to evaluate many other conditions like overlap situations and etc.,\nDifference between library call and a system call\nPriority inversion in a RTOS and its solutions\nRound 5 (Manager): Qualcomm aspirations, culture and how you look to be next, feedback from us on the interview, Nothing much… just a casual talk. Round 5 (Hr): Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation? just a casual talk. Note: All rounds, you need to explain about your project clearly and they can ask some really good questions from your project. Be out and out clear with your projects and CV. After this, I was actually into my Dream Company and Happy..!! I suggest that always listen carefully to an interviewer, they’ll definitely help if you have any doubt. Tell them your approach at least if you are not able to code it. Practice writing code on paper. For Qualcomm Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings and Trees are concepts which are very generally asked. Data structures & algorithms, OS should be proficiently practiced.

        "content_summary": "It was really good experience at Qualcomm. I was interviewed for Associate Software Engineer and have an experience of an year, first by telephonic round and then F2F interview.\nRound-1 Telephonic around: 70 minutes (Taken by 2 persons)\n1. All they asked at first was about Projects done in my company and at college level. 2. Then main thing they ask was OS and its concepts:      \na. Memory management.      \nb. CPU scheduling.      \nc. Deadlock and its real time examples.      \nd. Questions on how two processes can communicate in OS, give different ways.\n3. Coding questions:      \nReverse a linked list.\nPrint left view of a binary tree.\nImplement your own memcpy. After completion of this round they asked me if I can travel to Hyderabad for further rounds.At 7th January 2017 I gave F2F interview.\nRound-2 F2F:120 minutes\nHe started with simple intro then explained me the position for which interview was going on. 1. Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word 'is' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find 'is' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using \"strcmp\" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1. Then he started with questions on OS      \na. Process and thread difference.      \nb. How will you handle 2 thread working on same MAP.Then asked several questions on mutex and different types of locking systems.      \nc. Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation? NOTE: One must be clear with pointers and memory management and DS questions. Basics of C is they ask a lot.\nAll Practice Problems for Qualcomm !\nRelated Practice Problems\nReverse a linked list\nLeft View of Binary Tree\nReverse Bits\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nDetect Loop in linked list\nSet Bits\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nQualcomm Interview Experience | Set 8 (Experienced)"

Maximum height to which prisoner can jump is given. Now since it was a rainy day all the walls are wet and when prisoner makes a jump he slips down l units. Calculate total no. of jumps he will have to make in order to escape\n. (Simple logical question) 2.\nFind smallest substring which contains all characters from a given string?\nInput string1: “This is a test string” Input string2: “tist” Output: “t stri” 3.\nGiven a maze. Drop a mouse in the maze randomly, and place a piece of cheese in any cell. The mouse can move 4 directions up down left rightThere are some walls on the way to block certain directions for certain position. Design an algorithm for the mouse to find the cheese.\nNote: the mouse does not know where he is, and where the cheese is. He cannot find x,y for the position he is right now. for instance X X B D X D A X X D is the block with walls on 4 sides. If the mouse reaches the end of row or column, it gets the dead end. Mouse is A, cheese is B. Return true if mouse can reach the cheese else return false. Note: if your code doesn’t compile, they will not accept it even if your logic is correct.\nRound 3: (Technical Interview)\n• A brief intro of yourself and discussion on my projects. • Then he asked me about my fav. subject and language (DS and C++). • Questions on OOPS (almost all the concepts were covered like polymorphism, overriding, overloading, inheritance, concept of virtual fxns etc.) • He wrote a C++ code and asked me to write the output. • Some questions on DS and then he asked me to\nwrite algo for reversing a linked list.\n• Then he asked me to explain one of the questions that I had attempted in the coding round. (They just want to make sure that you know the logic). Round 4: (Technical Interview) • Topics in DS that I am comfortable with and the ones with which I am not. • Unfortunately this time he asked me questions from the later. They don’t want a correct answer but just want to see how you approach in such questions. • Questions from bit-wise operators • Then he asked me to explain other one of the two questions I had attempted in coding round.\nRound 5: (HR Interview)\nA quick intro Discussion on my projects What you know about their company apart from ppt. Make sure you study their website inside-out before you go for interviews, this shows your passion to work for their company. Questions on strengths, weakness and hobbies.

Round-2 : Technical Round (1 hour 10 minutes). The interviewer was very friendly and was trying to find out how much u can think. 1) Given a rotated array around a pivot element find a number x in the array.(write code in log n time). 2)Given 50 red and 50 blue balls, arrange them in 2 bags in such a way that the probability of taking out a red ball in 1st attempt is strictly > 1/2. 3) reverse a linked list. 4) The concept behind why a sewage lid on a road is round-shaped.Trying to find out how much u can think. (because the lid wont go inside in any way as a circle is uniform 360 degree.Rest any shape can go inside along the diagonal vertically). 5) find the depth of a tree. 6) A cake is on table.Another piece is cut from anywhere in the cake.Using a single cut divide the cake into 2 parts.(cut along the line joining the mid-points of the cake and the piece.) 7) write full working code for printing a matrix in spiral form. 8) Measure 4 litres water using 2 containers of capacity 5 and 3 litres respectively.(infinite supply of water). Round-2 Technical Round (50 minutes). A good 10-minutes discussion on my project. Next I was made to write full code for every question. 1) Iterative preorder traversal. 2) Iterative inorder traversal. 3) Reverse a string wordwise. (Let the input string be “i like this program very much”. The function should change the string to “much very program this like i”). 4) Calculate a^b in logn and find the total number of multiplications.(check binary representation of b and count 1's for the number of multiplications.)

        "content_summary": "I was recently interviewed by OLA, I could not make it after the last round. All rounds I had were telephonic, in the last round I was asked to code on collabedit. Round 1 (around 35 min): 1. Given a matrix containing 0's and 1's. Find all the rows which are having 1's at same position. Give all sets satisfying this. 2. In a stock market given are price of shares spread over a week. On what day should I buy and what day should i sell to get maximum profit. 3. Being a computer engineer why did I not opt for system side programming than web domain. (I had expr in web domain) 4. I had expr in web domain so he asked: What is the difference between web browser request and ajax call request. -- It is simple, by ajax call partial web page can be loaded. 5. Have you worked on ruby on rails? Round 2 : 1. Given a matrix containing numbers. Find the 0's and make all the rows and columns corresponding to that index as 0. 2. Design a structure for a File Uploader service (eg. Dropbox, google drive). It is a service where multiple people can upload data at the same time and it also lists the top five uploaders (who uploaded the maximum number of files). 3. Puzzle: There is an employer and a worker, the employer has a gold bar of 7 units and he has to give 1unit each on a day for 7 days. The employer has a magical knife which doesn't work once it performs two cuts(1 cut divides the bar into two parts) on the bar. How will you cut so that 1 unit on each day can be given to the worker. 4. Print left view of binary tree. Round 3 : 1. He discussed what things they work on Ola. How these things are implemented. Like he mentioned of bar code a product has and catalog kind of thing. 2. I had to explain what project I am working on currently, what is the team size. 3. a)Since I had worked on SQL and databases, so he asked me what data structure will I use to implement a database. --I gave hashmap as a soln (the key is our primary key and other fields we can store in an object which will be value for hashmap) b)Now, If in case you want to find all names starting with a particular word (eg. ram....).How will you do that? -- gave trie structure as soln. c)Now you need to find students whose marks are between a range i.e. between two numbers. How will you do, what data structure will you take in this case? -- a simple solution was that, take binary search tree and do inorder traversal of that (I couldn't answer this, not clicked me) 4. Do you want to ask anything? Round 4 : 1. The server receives a ping every 30 secs. The ping is load avg on the machine at that time. Find 90% percentile of the load average on the machine at any time instant. 2. Find missing number in an AP.\nRelated Practice Problems\nStock buy and sell\nMaximum Difference\nAll Practice Problems for Ola-Cabs !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nOLA Interview Experience | Set 7 (For SDE-1)"

        "content_summary": "Round 1 (Written) \nAround 140 students appeared for the offline test. \n\n\nThere were 20 MCQs that to be done in (30 minutes), questions were from OS,DBMS,Datastructures. \nAfter that coding round was there (paper coding) in which 3 questions were given and we have to attempt any 2 (1 hour) \n\n1. Write your own sqrt() function. the function should return square root if it is a perfect square else return floor(sqrt(x)) \n2. Given an array containing positive and negative integers. you have to find the smallest missing positive number. your code should run in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n3. Given an array of strings, find whether the strings can be chained or not to form a circle. A string x can be put before another string y if last character of x is same as first character of y. \n\nAfter round-1 , 19 people were shortlisted for the interviews. \n\n\n\n\nRound 2 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. Tell me about yourself. Meanwhile he(interviewer) looked into my CV and asked about my projects. \nI have done 3 projects so he started discussion CUDA and parallel programming and how you implemented over images to detect edges and how much gain factor achieved. \nsecondly,I have made an project on online voting system so he asked me to draw E-R diagram, schemas and the relationship between them and their functionalities.About (25-30) minutes discussion. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth smallest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n\n3. Suppose you have server where multiple requests are coming at time to,t1,t2...Now suppose a user hits at any particular time t on the server then server should return the last request. you have to design the datastructure for the same. \nI suggested that we can use stack that will return the last request, he then asked me to do for last 10 requests then I suggested to use array of structures which will store request no. and timestamp along with them.Now at any time t we can move 10 elements back but he said that suppose user hits frequently then every time i will have to traverse back again and again so time complexity will be much high, I agreed and suggested another solution similar to LRU implementation so that the requests which are coming frequently can be processed faster. then he modified question that user wants requests of last 1 minute and he gave a hint that is it necessary to store all requests can we not just store requests of every 1 min only,then suddenly it clicked to me, I suggested to use deque for 60 secs now suppose request arrives at 61st sec then we can just add that at rear and remove one from front maintaining a window of 60 seconds.He was satisfied but he want that no deletion should be there so I told him to use circular deque so that we can replace previous elements.He was completely satisfied now with the approach.(About 35 min. discussion) \n\n4. Given an array containing prices of a share of 30 days.A person has 1 share which he can buy and sell any number of times, you have to find the maximum profit which can be earned. \nI suggested one approach to create two auxiliary array MIN from left and MAX from right and traverse both simultaneously if difference between MAX[i] and MIN[i] is greater than maxDiff then update maxDIff and store current index and add to sum if index+1 is not equal to current iteration index and finally return sum.He tried some test cases over my code and found that for some cases it was giving wrong answer,then he asked me that how is my command over dynamic programming,I told I know only the standard ones and no other experience,then he said this question is of DP but he was happy to see my approach.(About 20-25 min.) \n\n\n\n\nRound 3 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. She(interviewer) asked me if I attempted 3rd question in written test, I said I attempted only 1st and 2nd, then she gave me paper and told to implement the 3rd question. \nI suggested an approach to use two arrays of structures(for first characters and last characters) which will contain boolean value to mark presence of character in string and also its index. Now compare two arrays and see that if both arrays have same boolean value and different indices for all first and last characters. If so then strings can form a chain else not.She was in doubt for my solution so she found a testcase where my code was giving wrong answer,so she told me to look for another solution,I came up with another approach and told her that we can make a directed graph from first and last characters and then traverse it in DFS, now suppose if the visited node is visited again and count of total visited nodes is same as total nodes then we can say that strings will form a chain, now she was satisfied with approach and asked me to write code, now as my graph was weak i was in shock,so she said to just write the pseudocode. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth largest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nI suggested to declare a static variable count which will increment count if node visited in inorder and if count becomes k, I will print that node's data and return. Then she asked me how static works and difference between global and static. \n\n3. Given a mobile keypad of say nokia phone and a dictionary which has all the meaningful words which can be formed, suppose now user types some number(input) then your program must suggest all the meaningful words which are present in dictionary.Before implementing this she asked me the datastructure to store the dictionary efficiently and then how will you use this datastructure to make code. \nAt first, I suggested I will store dictionary in 2-D array and lexicograpphically sort it, now suppose user types a number the string starting with that character is searched in the array. she said to reduce complexity because dictionary may contain 1000s of words,then I suggested to use trie datastructure to store and search the string, she was satisfied now and asked me to explain the concept. \n4.Given preorder and postorder of a graph, how can you construct the graph. \nAs I heard this question, i was stuck for 2 minutes but then I said as far as graph is concerned I dont know about it but a unique tree cannot be constructed with preorder and postorder so as graph,so inorder is needed, she was happy and agreed on answer. \n\n\n\n\nRound 4 (Technical) (2:30 hr) \n1. Suppose a linked list is given and there is a loop, you have to find orphan nodes in O(n) time. orphan nodes are the nodes outside the loop. \n\n2. Design a BRTS traffic signalling system such that no two vehicle clashes. Note that BRTS bus will follow the BRTS traffic lights B1,B2,B3,B4 in 4 directions and regular traffic will follow regular traffic lights R1,R2,R3,R4 only. In input only maximum cycle time was given(time after which the process repeates) check for all corner cases (traffic lights have two states only (RED and GREEN)).you have to tell any one possible combination of traffic lights under maximum cycle time. (About 1hr discussion). \n\n3. Suppose a linked list is given but we dont know the count of nodes, you have to find the kth node from last without counting the nodes. \n4. Given an array of n integers such some elements are in the range 0 to n-1 and some out of range may be negative.You have to rearrange array such that all elements which are in range appear on their index and rest appear in sorted manner for indexes not present.This should be done in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nEg- suppose n=6 ,4 5 2 3 6 -3 output= -3,6,2,3,4,5 \n\n5. How can you implement stack using queue/queues. \n6. How can you sort the elements with the help of queue. \nI suggested one O(n) time solution along with O(n) extra space.He asked to do in O(1) space so I suggested deque, he seemed satisfied. \n\nonly 4 were selected till this round (I was one of them) \n\nRound 5 (Bar Raiser) (30 minutes) \n\n1. find the length of longest palindrome in a string starting from index 0. \n2. find if a string A is present in string B or not. \n3. find the length of longest prefix in a string \n\nAfter this 2 were selected finally and unfortunately I was not amongst them as they might have thought i was little stress out. At last I would suggest that your approach and concepts must be strong as they always give questions with some variations. \n\nRelated Practice ProblemsSmallest Positive missing numberCount SquaresCircle of stringsCheck for subsequenceStock buy and sellLongest Palindrome in a String\n\n \n\n\nAll Practice Problems for Accolite ! \n\n\n \n \nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nAccolite Interview Experience | Set 4 (On-Campus)"

        "content_summary": "Recently makemytrip visited our Campus and I got selected in recruitment drive.The placement drive consisted of 4 rounds. Round1: MCQ and coding round It was an online test of 60 minutes consisting of 20 aptitude question and 3 coding question. Platform used for the test was of makemytrip and slightly difficult to understand. Question1: Calculate the power of a ^ b mod c using logn approach.The thing that was to be taken care of was that you did not needed to return or print your answer but you had to store it in their predefined global variable. You could easily find the solution on geeksforgeeks site. Question2: Given a sentence you were supposed to calculate the count of Capital , small letter and number.Question seemed to be quite easy but the pick was that you needed to store the answer in char* output variable in the form of c1:c2:c3 where c1 represent count of capital letter c2 represent count of small letter and c3 represent count of number. (Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,\"%d:%d:%d\",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities . Determine the maximum number of non conflicting activities that you can achieve. (Hint : make a structure of start and finish time and sort according to finishing interval) I solved 2 completely and 1 partially Tip:Since they have only one sample test case so even you are not able to solve the coding question just store the hard coded answer in that variable. I did that in last :P) Out of 110 students 30 students got selected for Personal Interview round. Round 2: Personal Interview Since I was last candidate in that list waiting from 10:30 am My turn came at 10:30 PM.The interviewer was very cool and friendly.He started with asking tell me about yourself and what projects I have done.After half hour rigerous discussion over my project and making schema of databases I used in project He started asking question on ds. Question1: Sort a linklist consisting of 0,1,2's. (Hint: I used hashmap of stl in c++ to store the count of 0,1 and 2) Question 2: Given a stock You need to find the maximum profit you can earn .You are allowed to buy and sell as many number of time you can.) Question 3:Design a treeset in java. (Hint:I told him to use BST but he told to think of more optimized way so Ii told AVL and wrote functions for insertion in AVL tree) Question4:Diffrentiate between method overloading and method overriding.What are static blocks in java. Question5: Drilling question on deployment descriptor,struts,mysql. Round3: Personal Interview The interviewer seemed to be exhausted . He asked me that Since you are the last person so all the question you would have asked. So tell me what all question you have asked. I told him distinct palindromic substring in string, LIS, LCS etc students told that you are asking.He thought for a while and told me to write standard bfs code for graph traversal. Question2: You have been given a matrix of character and a dictionary.You need to find the valid words that you can obtain from it and print it. (Hint:I used dfs to find the valid sequence and assumed that all words are stored in a hashmap) After these He asked 6 puzzles to be solved in a given time. Puzzle 1 : 1.5 hen give 1.5 egg in 1.5 day. How many hens are required to have 4 dozen of egg in 6 days. Puzzle 2: 2 ropes and take 1hr to burn. Calculate 45 min Puzzle 3:10 jar with 10gm marble in each jar.One jar contain 9gm marbles only.Find the defective jar in one turn. Puzzle4:150 person are standing in a queue in sorted order.A blind person comes and wants to be at right position in queue.So he asks any person whether he can stand in front of him.He will reply in Yes or No . You have to find the right place after 2Yes. Give a strategy to find the correct place. (Hint:This puzzle can be reduced to egg drop puzzle) Puzzle 5:25 horse having race find top 3 Puzzle 6:A person is riding a car and he sees a milestone A. After 1hr he sees milestone B which has digits reversed of A.After one hour more he finds a milestone C which contains all the digits of A and B . Given that A < B < C find the speed of car. (Other question that were asked from my friend 1.Distinct Palindrome in string 2.Transaction minimize problem 3.LCS and LIS (dp approach) 4.Diameter of tree 5.Pattern Matching Algorithm (KMP)) HR round: He asked me about my family background,what I do ,hobbies.What I know about makemytrip.What location I would prefer , whether I am satisfied with package or not,Working environment etc, It lasted for half hour. Tip:(Be expressive,Think out loud,Be confident.

They engross more on DSA and dev is the edge point if you had done it.\nHR Round(Telephonic):\nQuestions like could have you done better in all previous rounds and how, what has been your greatest failure, what do you know about us or our company, and many more.\nThis round was all about testing the candidate and what steps did I take up to tackle the above-mentioned problems.\nSome more questions were asked. Be positive and aloud during the interview. Don't be nervous and in rush to answer the question. Take your time. Interviewers are mainly nice and have a helping nature (in my case they were very nice, polite, helped me wherever I got stuck).

The test included three questions:\nGiven an array find a subsequence with maximum sum but all the elements must be non-adjacent\nGiven an array consisting of whole numbers, push all the zeroes at the end but the order of positive numbers must be same\nGiven an array consisting of only integers, write a program to put all the negative numbers on even indices and the non-negative numbers on the odd indices and if +ve numbers are more in number place them at the end after all -ve numbers have been placed and same goes for the +ve numbers too.\nSolving two may take you to the interview (I guess), the first round had two questions\nGiven an array, find all the subarrays (contiguous) of even length which has the equal left sum and a right sum. Ex:- [2,4,6,6,4,2,10], for this the answer is 4, i.e. [2,4,6,6,4,2],[4,6,6,4,2,10],[4,6,6,4],[6,6]. Asked me to write code, firstly I tried doing it by brute then it came to be O(n3) solution and was unable to efficiency.\nThen he asked me what's a Trie Node, deleting and adding strings in trienode and I explained it to him\nAsked about my project and that's it I cleared first round\nI was the only one sent to the 2nd round\nFirstly, he asked me to briefly introduce about myself and then asked why am I trying an IT company when I'm a civil engineering student and then I explained to him about why and all things... There were three questions:\nGiven a nxm matrix filled with all 0s and 1s, find the biggest subsquare which has all 1s in it. Done it using Dynamic Programming\nReverse a linked list in a group. Ex: 1→2→3→4→5→6→NULL with k=3 then the output must be 3→2→1→6→5→4→NULL.\nThe tough question for me and the reason I couldn't get selected (I think that's the reason) Given an array with numbers in it, you will have n number of queries, each query will have 3 inputs x, y, val where x and y represents the start and end indices of a subarray whose all elements must be increased by a value 'val' and then there would be n queries again where each query will have x and y where each query must be returned with the sum of the subarray [x index to y index] of the updated array. At first glance, everyone would say that just add every time a query has been sent but then there would be no point of asking. So, I said I would use union and intersection of the indices and somehow get to the answer and so he asked how to find union and intersection and that's where I toppled and couldn't answer and that's it they said ok and I left. After an hour, the results came and they didn't select anyone from IT profile\nAll Practice Problems for Paytm !\nRelated Practice Problems\nMove all zeroes to end of array\nReverse a Linked List in groups of given size.\nArray of alternate +ve and -ve no.s\nStickler Thief\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nPaytm Interview Experience | Set 9"

One was easy, two were medium, and last was hard.\nGiven a matrix of size N*N (empty) and k (number of operations). In each operation, you will be given two values r (rth row) and c (cth column) and you have to place 'X' in rth row cells and cth column cells. After each operation, you are required to print the number of empty cells in the matrix.\n\nExample:\nn = 5, k = 3\n1st operation : r = 3, c = 2  \n2nd operation : r = 4, c = 4\n3rd operation : r = 3, c = 5\nOutput (Total empty cells after each operation):\n16\n9\n6\nThere are N students and K toffees. Students can take toffees if both conditions satisfy:\nHe/she must be able to take all the candies he/she wants.\nAll his/her friends must to able to take all the candies they want to take.\nTechnical Round 1: Based on Coding, Data Structure and Algorithm, DBMS, behaviour\nRelated to pointers (mainly pointer pointing to a 2D array) and address (in-depth)(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointer-array-array-pointer/)\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-and-last-occurrences-of-x3116/1\nPractice Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-and-last-occurrences-of-x3116/1\nFind all the triplets: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-triplets-with-zero-sum/1\nPractice Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-triplets-with-zero-sum/1\nDBMS queries and questions\nTechnical Round 2: Based on Project, Coding, Data Structure, and Algorithm, OOP, DBMS, behaviour\nDetailed discussion on projects like stacks and technologies used, the problem faced, how did you manage to make your app efficient, database structure and schemas, functional and non-functional requirements, security, scalability, etc.\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-anagrams-together/1\nWhat is a singleton class and how to make such a class in Java/C++.(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-class-java/)\nWhat is multithreading and how to avoid multi-threads to access a resource at a time? (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/synchronized-in-java/)\nWhat is Regex? How to efficiently find all the data (documents) in the database that don't match the given Regex ?.\nWhat are the benefits of using Mongo DB and Firebase as databases (I told them that I have used Firebase and Firestore)?\nHow to avoid compiler to do optimization for some certain resource. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-volatile-qualifier-in-c/)\nO(n) time and O(1) space without changing the relative position of elements.

How have you applied unit testing to it?\nHow did you optimize your React Application? (My answer was: using Lazy loading, dividing into modules, optimizing webpack, etc).\nQuestion on how Encryption is different than Hashing? (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hashing-and-encryption/)\nWhat are the problems faced by React? (https://www.growth-rocket.com/blog/a-closer-look-at-client-side-server-side-rendering/)\nConclusion: Interviewers mainly focus on how you approach the question rather than you solved the problem completely. They engross more on DSA and dev is the edge point if you had done it.\nHR Round(Telephonic):\nQuestions like could have you done better in all previous rounds and how, what has been your greatest failure, what do you know about us or our company, and many more.\nThis round was all about testing the candidate and what steps did I take up to tackle the above-mentioned problems.\nSome more questions were asked. Be positive and aloud during the interview. Don't be nervous and in rush to answer the question. Take your time. Interviewers are mainly nice and have a helping nature (in my case they were very nice, polite, helped me wherever I got stuck).  Believe in yourself and always in God.\nThanks to GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth, CodeChef, Codeforces.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nIntuit Interview Experience for Summer Internship Off-Campus (2 months)"

Search in a Rotated Array 4.Value equal to index value finally something new.. 5. given a sorted array say A : (-4,-2,0,1,4,6,8,10). There is a function f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c , apply this function on A where x is any ith element from array A and a,b,c belongs to set of real numbers. Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon. I said Java, Spring MVC for backend and html,css, javascript for front end and suddenly he asked what is difference between Java and javascript. Could not figure out at that time. Javascript is also an object oriented language an can be used at server side like node js.

Round 1\nGiven an array of sorted integers, with many of them repeating, and an element x, find the number of occurrences of x. Expected time complexity O(lgn)\nYou have a certain amount of money X, which, if you invest in a bank, gets split into these denominations every year – X/2, X/3, X/4. After every year, you are allowed to withdraw any denomination and any number of these three (including all of them. If you withdraw all of it the total money you’ll have is x/2 + x/3 + x/4, where x is the money in the bank at the time of withdrawing). Say you withdraw X/2, the money left in the bank x = X/3 + X/4. Now for the next year, this x gets split into x/2, x/3, x/4. And so on. Find the maximum profit you can make.\nGiven two words and a dictionary, find the minimum number of changes to be made to the first word so as to form the second word, if you are only allowed to make one change at a time. For example: Word1 = CAT Word 2 = FAR. Words in the dictionary are = { ACT, CAN, CAR, FAT, FAN, FAR }. Answer: min number of transformations is 2. CAT -> CAR -> FAR (or CAT -> FAT -> FAR). Hint: think shortest paths in a graph\nRound 2\nGiven an array of n digits (from 0 to 9), and an integer k, find the maximum number that can be formed by the array if you are allowed k swaps between adjacent elements.\nSearch for a given element x in a sorted and rotated array\nDiscussion on projects and work experience\nRound 3\nNuts and Bolts problem. I was asked to write code for it\nGiven a string, find out if it is composed of a repeating pattern.

There is a function f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c , apply this function on A where x is any ith element from array A and a,b,c belongs to set of real numbers. Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon. I said Java, Spring MVC for backend and html,css, javascript for front end and suddenly he asked what is difference between Java and javascript. Could not figure out at that time. Javascript is also an object oriented language an can be used at server side like node js.

The next line contains an array of size n and next m lines contains two integers x and y each which represents that there exists a bidirectional edge between x and y. We have to output the number of permutations of the array which are lucky. A permutation is said to be lucky if for every Vi in the array there exists an edge between Vi and Vi+1.\nEg Input : 3 2 Output : 2 ( 1-2-3 and 3-2-1)\n1 2 3\n1 2\n2 3\nYou have been an integer n and an array of size n as input. You have to print the count of special numbers in an array. A number is said to be special if it is divisible by at least one other element of the array.\nArticel Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divisibility-check/\nEg: Input: 3 Output: 2 ( 2 and 3 because they are divisible by 1)\n1 2 3\nYou have been given a mXn matrix and an integer k as input.

We have to destruct the matrix completely so that sum of the elements destucted by us (not that destructed itself) is minimum, given the constraint that atleast one of the elements in a row should be canceled by us. Output is that minimum sum. c) Given N points in a grid we have to find all different(altlest one uncommon side) squares of side length K. N, K and points will be input and number of different squares will be output. d) Given an array we have to sort that in inceasing order such that value of V is minimum. where V = sum(position of element in given array * position of element sorted array), position of element is 1 based. Output is sorted array and V. Round 2 (Interview Round 1): Concepts of OOPs like Polymorphism and Inheritance and questions related to projects done. Round 3 (Interview Round 2): 1. Some more OOPs concepts. 2. Data Structures like Hashmap, Sorting algos (Quick sort and Merge sort) (complextiy and just how to implement them). 3. What is Java (as it was my primary programming language). 4. Difference between static and dynamic programming languages. 5. Implementation of Linked List (Code with proper syntax). 6. How to find Square root of a number (without using inbuilt functions, best efficient way O(logN)). 7. In a array each number is stored twice except one that is placed only once. (Best efficient O(logN)). 8. In a sorted array having elements from 1 to N, only one is missing and so array size is N-1. Find missing number in best efficient way (O(logN)) and without possibility of overflow.\nRelated Practice Problems\nCount Palindrome Sub-Strings of a String\nFind the element that appears once in sorted array\nAlone in couple\nCount Squares\nDistinct palindromic substrings\nMissing number in array\nAll Practice Problems for Ola-Cabs !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nOLA Interview Experience | Set 11 ( For Internship)"

        "content_summary": "Company Name: Flipkart\nOn-Campus - MANIT \n\nRound 1:Coding round \n\nTo get a chance to participate in this coding rounds, we were asked to fill forms . the candidates  and were short listed here on the basis of pointer ( 7.5 and above  were all selected, for people with pointer 7  to 7.5, there projects and internships were taken into consideration to be allowed to appear in this round) \n\n  3 CODING questions in 90 mins on hackerrank. \n\nQ1 ) Was a simple question, all you had to do was find a PnC formula and just put the values in it to get the answer. \n\nQ2)Was based on array . This was a medium level question, 7/11 test case passed using brute force (O(n^2)). An accurate solution of which is actually in O (n), but i modified my code and managed to get all the 11 test cases right using just a slight modification in my brute force approach! \n\nQ3)A matrix was given, the solution to which was by applying  BFS on it but not exactly that. I could not understand the problem enough as I was running out of time ! \nThe name of the Question was \"Marathon\" and said was a lot similar to some other famour problem named \"Rat in a maze\". \n\n In this round out of 150 students, 22 were shortlisted for interviews, and 10 were kept on waiting list. \n\nRound 2: TECHNICAL  I \n\nIn technical round one, all of us were asked 3 questions. The level of questions was actually easy, and most were selected only if they could answer all of the 3 right ! \n\nQ1) N-1 elements in an array from 1 to n, find the missing one! \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1\n\nI answered it easily so he added the constrain of over flowing numbers, which took me a little while but I got it \n\nQ2) K distance sort \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nearly-sorted-algorithm/0\n\nHe had clearly stated me that this can be done using normal sorting algo in O(nlogn), but I had to give a more optimized one. \n\nI proposed a solution using a stack, which some how worked for the test case that he gave me, but he proved it wrong and gave me a hint to use another data structure, I got the hint and realised it  was to be done using min heap. Time complexity of which was O(nlogk) ! \n\nQ3)Circular tour \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/circular-tour/1\n\n For this question i gave him a more optimized solution than brute force but with the same complexity, but he did not give me much time for this question as they were running late on schedule. \n\nLater I got to know from sources that I was rated 3.7 out of 5 in this round, which was more than a lot of others. \n\nRound 3: TECHNICAL   II \n\n17 out of 22 made it to this round. \n\nIn this round the questions asked were tough, but the interviewer was very suggestive and kept dropping hints. \n\nQ1)Sum of minimum elements of all sub arrays. \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-minimum-elements-of-all-subarrays/ \n\nI gave an immediate solution in nlogn time, but he asked me to optimize it. He gave me hell a lot of hints but I could not solve this easy question. He then said that they are running out of time so let's move to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ2)Cut off trees for golf \n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/ \n\nAfter a little bit of pickering I was able to give him a solution in O(r^2c^2), but he did not ask me to improve it. He asked me to write the code for it and tell me what algo was I using. I did write a rough algo just enough to give him a clear idea of what was I thinking and he was satisfied with that ! \nAnd we moved on to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ3) LRU cache implementation using array, stack/queue, doubly linked list, circular linked list, Hash map. \nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1\n\nI did them all very easily, and I also told him the story why was I good at it. He was happy enough to let me go again stating that time was a constrain and they had to take further interviews too ! \n\n  \n\nRound 4: HIRING MANAGER ROUND \n\nI was pretty confident that if I make it till here, I will get the job too, which is what happened. \nI entered the room, He asked me \"How was I \" and I told him\" I was hungry\"......that did set the tone of the interview to a casual talk and made him comfortable with me. 5-10 mins into the interview, he commented that I was very honest. ANd so went on the conversation and the usual interview Questions. \n\nWhere do you see yourselves in 5 years? \n\nWhat is your strength and weakness? To which I answered as hard working, being both my weakness and strength and justified it . \n\nHe asked me about my story if JEE and getting into this college. \n\nHow did I grow technically and personality wise in the last 3 years? \n\nand usual questions like that ....to which I gave pretty interesting answers ! \n\nWe then discussed a little about any one of my projects of my choice and I some how led that discussion to about how every college group project is like one person doing the entire work, to him I also told that in one of the projects I did the entire work  and everyone got the credit, and how once in second year my partner did the entire project and I got pointers for it too. He was convinced that I was very honest and true !! \n\nAt last he asked me if I had any questions for him . \n\nI asked him only one question, which was that just in case if I get selected for this job at flipkart or even if I do not, what is that one thing that I should improve or learn about my technical part or my personality part. He did not say anything about my technical skills, He only said that he got a picture that I was not passionate enough . I also joined hands and agreed on it and gave a little justification on it. He also said that  I should not take that personally and that he only siad that because I asked so. \n\nThat is where the HM round ended. I got up, we shook hands and he said that mine was the best HM interview he had in the entire day(my was 2nd last interview of the day), and that he had an interesting conversation with me and truly enjoyed it ! \n\n  \n\nI was on Cloud 7 at the end of this interview. \n\nNext day the results were announced. Out of the 12 who appeared for the HM round. Only one candidate was rejected. 9 people (inclusive of me) we awarded  6 month internship + Full time job after that. 2 were awarded a 6 month internship and they would then evaluate their performance and see if they should hire them for full time or not ! Only one guy who made it to the HM round did not get an offer ! \n\n  \n\n \n \nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nFlipkart Interview Experience for SDE-1"
