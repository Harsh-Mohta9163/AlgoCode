        "content_summary": "Round 1: The first round was an online coding round which consisted of 3 coding questions to be attempted in 90 minutes. Question 1 :- There is a meeting scheduled in an office that lasts for time t and starts at time 0. In between the meeting there are n presentations whose start and end times are given i.e. the ith presentation starts at s[i] and ends at e[i]-1. The presentations do not overlap with each other. You are given k, the maximum number of presentations that you can reschedule keeping the original order intact. Note that the duration of the presentation can't be changed. You can only change the start and end time. Your task is to maximize the longest time period in which there is no presentation scheduled during the meeting. Constraints :- 1<=t<=1, 000, 000, 000 0<=k<=n 1<=n<=100, 000 e[i]<=s[i+1],   0<=i <n-1 s[i] < e[i] for 0<=i<=n-1   Question 2 :- You are given a n x  m grid consisting of values 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that you can enter that cell and 0 implies that entry to that cell is not allowed. You start at the upper-left corner of the grid (1, 1) and you have to reach the bottom-right corner (n, m) such that you can only move in the right or down direction from every cell. Your task is to calculate the total number of ways of reaching the target. Constraints :- 1<=n, m<=10, 000   Question 3 :- You are given a list of edges in a graph and for each pair of vertices that are connected by an edge, there are two edges between them, one curved edge and one straight edge i.e. the tuple (x, y, w1, w2) means that between vertices x and y, there is a straight edge with weight w1 and a curved edge with weight w2. You are given two vertices a and b and you have to go from a to b through a series of edges such that in the entire path you can use at most 1 curved edge. Your task is to find the shortest path from a to b satisfying the above condition.   Round 2: This was a technical round and lasted for about an hour. I was asked to design a Snakes And Ladder game and code the same in the language of my choice. I used random numbers to design the board and following which I was asked to play the game between two players and I coded the same. He introduced a trick to the question and asked me to rate the difficulty of the board. I thought in terms of the shortest path(Breadth First Search) from start to the end but he said that a better approach would be to calculate the probability of reaching a particular number from the start. So I used Dynamic Programming to calculate the probability of reaching a particular number in x number of moves where 1<=x<=maximum cap on the number of moves following which a tie would be declared. He then asked me that he didn't want a game that would finish in just 15 moves as that would make the game boring. So I was told to  calculate the probability that the game finishes in 15 to  100 moves. Finally he asked me to tell just by looking at the position of the players that who was in the winning position at that moment. He was satisfied by my responses. Round 3: This was a problem solving round and lasted for 75 minutes. He gave me a very complicated question. Here it goes... There are 3 integers a, b, w. There  are 2 equations -\nw+a=b\na (bitwise AND) b =0;\nI was given the value of w and he asked me to calculate the number of pairs (a, b) satisfying the two equations. Assume  that there are no overflows. I used Recursion + Bit Manipulation to solve this and he seemed satisfied with my approach though I required some of his help as well.   P.S.  :- I got a call for an offer 3 hours later.    \n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nUber Interview Experience (On Campus for Internship 2018-19)"

In between the meeting there are n presentations whose start and end times are given i.e. the ith presentation starts at s[i] and ends at e[i]-1. The presentations do not overlap with each other. You are given k, the maximum number of presentations that you can reschedule keeping the original order intact. Note that the duration of the presentation can't be changed. You can only change the start and end time. Your task is to maximize the longest time period in which there is no presentation scheduled during the meeting. Constraints :- 1<=t<=1, 000, 000, 000 0<=k<=n 1<=n<=100, 000 e[i]<=s[i+1],   0<=i <n-1 s[i] < e[i] for 0<=i<=n-1   Question 2 :- You are given a n x  m grid consisting of values 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that you can enter that cell and 0 implies that entry to that cell is not allowed. You start at the upper-left corner of the grid (1, 1) and you have to reach the bottom-right corner (n, m) such that you can only move in the right or down direction from every cell. Your task is to calculate the total number of ways of reaching the target. Constraints :- 1<=n, m<=10, 000   Question 3 :- You are given a list of edges in a graph and for each pair of vertices that are connected by an edge, there are two edges between them, one curved edge and one straight edge i.e. the tuple (x, y, w1, w2) means that between vertices x and y, there is a straight edge with weight w1 and a curved edge with weight w2. You are given two vertices a and b and you have to go from a to b through a series of edges such that in the entire path you can use at most 1 curved edge. Your task is to find the shortest path from a to b satisfying the above condition.   Round 2: This was a technical round and lasted for about an hour. I was asked to design a Snakes And Ladder game and code the same in the language of my choice. I used random numbers to design the board and following which I was asked to play the game between two players and I coded the same. He introduced a trick to the question and asked me to rate the difficulty of the board. I thought in terms of the shortest path(Breadth First Search) from start to the end but he said that a better approach would be to calculate the probability of reaching a particular number from the start. So I used Dynamic Programming to calculate the probability of reaching a particular number in x number of moves where 1<=x<=maximum cap on the number of moves following which a tie would be declared. He then asked me that he didn't want a game that would finish in just 15 moves as that would make the game boring. So I was told to  calculate the probability that the game finishes in 15 to  100 moves. Finally he asked me to tell just by looking at the position of the players that who was in the winning position at that moment. He was satisfied by my responses. Round 3: This was a problem solving round and lasted for 75 minutes. He gave me a very complicated question. Here it goes... There are 3 integers a, b, w. There  are 2 equations -\nw+a=b\na (bitwise AND) b =0;\nI was given the value of w and he asked me to calculate the number of pairs (a, b) satisfying the two equations. Assume  that there are no overflows. I used Recursion + Bit Manipulation to solve this and he seemed satisfied with my approach though I required some of his help as well.   P.S.  :- I got a call for an offer 3 hours later.    \n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nUber Interview Experience (On Campus for Internship 2018-19)"

CGPA cutoff: 7.0 Branches Eligible: All circuital branches\nOnline Round:\nAn online round was conducted on hackerrank. The duration of the test was 90 minutes. There were 5 MCQs ( 10 marks each, -3 negative marking) and two coding questions( one 35 marks, and the other 15 marks) MCQs were based on the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms. Proper in- depth knowledge was required to solve these MCQs. Coding questions: 1. Given a string, find the first non repeating character. 2. Given an array, find the number of contiguous subarrays such that the product of the elements of the subarray is less than or equal to a given positive integer k. ( Brute force gave TLE in this question. So proper optimised O(n) complexity solution was required) After the online round, 6 students were shortlisted out of 170 for the personal interviews.\nPersonal Interview Round 1:\n1.) Given a string, print all possible permutations of the characters of that strings. (Had to cover all the edge cases) 2.) What is elastic search. 3.) Modification of the first question, asked to give permuatations containing only 3 characters. Few more questions were asked on graphs.\nPersonal Interview Round 2:\n1.) Find the median of the stream of integers 2.) Talked about my resume and the projects I did 3.) Given a binary tree, check if it is Binary Search Tree without using extra space Few more questions on heaps. This round mostly revolved around trees and heap.\nPersonal Interview Round 3:\n1.) Talked about my Resume 2.) What is JSON 3.) What is REST api 4.) Egg dropping puzzle One more puzzle was asked. I cant recall it now\nPersonal Interview Round 4:\n1.) Discussed questions of the first online test( conducted on hacker rank) 2.) Questions on probability and statistics Few more HR questions Finally , two students were selected for the internship.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nGoldman Sachs Interview Experience | Set 32 (On campus)"

If no such slot exits, return an empty array.\nExamples:\nInput: slots1 = [[10,50], [60,120], [140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15], [60,70]], d = 8\nOutput: [60,68]\nExplanation: The only overlap is [60,70] (10 minutes), which is enough for an 8-minute meeting, so answer is [60,68]\nInput: slots1 = [[10,50], [60,120], [140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15], [60,70]], d = 12\nOutput: []\nExplanation: The only overlap is [60, 70] (10 minutes), but 12 minutes are needed, so no valid slot exists.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ slots1.size(), slots2.size()  ≤ 105\n-109 ≤ slots1[i], slots2[i] ≤ 109\n1 ≤ d ≤ 106"

        "content_summary": "Round 1: The first round was an online coding round which consisted of 3 coding questions to be attempted in 90 minutes. Question 1 :- There is a meeting scheduled in an office that lasts for time t and starts at time 0. In between the meeting there are n presentations whose start and end times are given i.e. the ith presentation starts at s[i] and ends at e[i]-1. The presentations do not overlap with each other. You are given k, the maximum number of presentations that you can reschedule keeping the original order intact. Note that the duration of the presentation can't be changed. You can only change the start and end time. Your task is to maximize the longest time period in which there is no presentation scheduled during the meeting. Constraints :- 1<=t<=1, 000, 000, 000 0<=k<=n 1<=n<=100, 000 e[i]<=s[i+1],   0<=i <n-1 s[i] < e[i] for 0<=i<=n-1   Question 2 :- You are given a n x  m grid consisting of values 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that you can enter that cell and 0 implies that entry to that cell is not allowed. You start at the upper-left corner of the grid (1, 1) and you have to reach the bottom-right corner (n, m) such that you can only move in the right or down direction from every cell. Your task is to calculate the total number of ways of reaching the target. Constraints :- 1<=n, m<=10, 000   Question 3 :- You are given a list of edges in a graph and for each pair of vertices that are connected by an edge, there are two edges between them, one curved edge and one straight edge i.e. the tuple (x, y, w1, w2) means that between vertices x and y, there is a straight edge with weight w1 and a curved edge with weight w2. You are given two vertices a and b and you have to go from a to b through a series of edges such that in the entire path you can use at most 1 curved edge. Your task is to find the shortest path from a to b satisfying the above condition.   Round 2: This was a technical round and lasted for about an hour. I was asked to design a Snakes And Ladder game and code the same in the language of my choice. I used random numbers to design the board and following which I was asked to play the game between two players and I coded the same. He introduced a trick to the question and asked me to rate the difficulty of the board. I thought in terms of the shortest path(Breadth First Search) from start to the end but he said that a better approach would be to calculate the probability of reaching a particular number from the start. So I used Dynamic Programming to calculate the probability of reaching a particular number in x number of moves where 1<=x<=maximum cap on the number of moves following which a tie would be declared. He then asked me that he didn't want a game that would finish in just 15 moves as that would make the game boring. So I was told to  calculate the probability that the game finishes in 15 to  100 moves. Finally he asked me to tell just by looking at the position of the players that who was in the winning position at that moment. He was satisfied by my responses. Round 3: This was a problem solving round and lasted for 75 minutes. He gave me a very complicated question. Here it goes... There are 3 integers a, b, w. There  are 2 equations -\nw+a=b\na (bitwise AND) b =0;\nI was given the value of w and he asked me to calculate the number of pairs (a, b) satisfying the two equations. Assume  that there are no overflows. I used Recursion + Bit Manipulation to solve this and he seemed satisfied with my approach though I required some of his help as well.   P.S.  :- I got a call for an offer 3 hours later.    \n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nUber Interview Experience (On Campus for Internship 2018-19)"

You start at the upper-left corner of the grid (1, 1) and you have to reach the bottom-right corner (n, m) such that you can only move in the right or down direction from every cell. Your task is to calculate the total number of ways of reaching the target. Constraints :- 1<=n, m<=10, 000   Question 3 :- You are given a list of edges in a graph and for each pair of vertices that are connected by an edge, there are two edges between them, one curved edge and one straight edge i.e. the tuple (x, y, w1, w2) means that between vertices x and y, there is a straight edge with weight w1 and a curved edge with weight w2. You are given two vertices a and b and you have to go from a to b through a series of edges such that in the entire path you can use at most 1 curved edge. Your task is to find the shortest path from a to b satisfying the above condition.   Round 2: This was a technical round and lasted for about an hour. I was asked to design a Snakes And Ladder game and code the same in the language of my choice. I used random numbers to design the board and following which I was asked to play the game between two players and I coded the same. He introduced a trick to the question and asked me to rate the difficulty of the board. I thought in terms of the shortest path(Breadth First Search) from start to the end but he said that a better approach would be to calculate the probability of reaching a particular number from the start. So I used Dynamic Programming to calculate the probability of reaching a particular number in x number of moves where 1<=x<=maximum cap on the number of moves following which a tie would be declared. He then asked me that he didn't want a game that would finish in just 15 moves as that would make the game boring. So I was told to  calculate the probability that the game finishes in 15 to  100 moves. Finally he asked me to tell just by looking at the position of the players that who was in the winning position at that moment. He was satisfied by my responses. Round 3: This was a problem solving round and lasted for 75 minutes. He gave me a very complicated question. Here it goes... There are 3 integers a, b, w. There  are 2 equations -\nw+a=b\na (bitwise AND) b =0;\nI was given the value of w and he asked me to calculate the number of pairs (a, b) satisfying the two equations. Assume  that there are no overflows. I used Recursion + Bit Manipulation to solve this and he seemed satisfied with my approach though I required some of his help as well.   P.S.  :- I got a call for an offer 3 hours later.    \n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nUber Interview Experience (On Campus for Internship 2018-19)"

CGPA cutoff: 7.0 Branches Eligible: All circuital branches\nOnline Round:\nAn online round was conducted on hackerrank. The duration of the test was 90 minutes. There were 5 MCQs ( 10 marks each, -3 negative marking) and two coding questions( one 35 marks, and the other 15 marks) MCQs were based on the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms. Proper in- depth knowledge was required to solve these MCQs. Coding questions: 1. Given a string, find the first non repeating character. 2. Given an array, find the number of contiguous subarrays such that the product of the elements of the subarray is less than or equal to a given positive integer k. ( Brute force gave TLE in this question. So proper optimised O(n) complexity solution was required) After the online round, 6 students were shortlisted out of 170 for the personal interviews.\nPersonal Interview Round 1:\n1.) Given a string, print all possible permutations of the characters of that strings. (Had to cover all the edge cases) 2.) What is elastic search. 3.) Modification of the first question, asked to give permuatations containing only 3 characters. Few more questions were asked on graphs.\nPersonal Interview Round 2:\n1.) Find the median of the stream of integers 2.) Talked about my resume and the projects I did 3.) Given a binary tree, check if it is Binary Search Tree without using extra space Few more questions on heaps. This round mostly revolved around trees and heap.\nPersonal Interview Round 3:\n1.) Talked about my Resume 2.) What is JSON 3.) What is REST api 4.) Egg dropping puzzle One more puzzle was asked. I cant recall it now\nPersonal Interview Round 4:\n1.) Discussed questions of the first online test( conducted on hacker rank) 2.) Questions on probability and statistics Few more HR questions Finally , two students were selected for the internship.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nGoldman Sachs Interview Experience | Set 32 (On campus)"

(20 minutes)\nAptitude and Reasoning Ability. (35 minutes)\nWorkstyles Assessment. (20 minutes)\nCoding Round. (70 minutes)\nThe first 3 sections were fairly easy, but one needs to be a tad bit quicker to finish all the questions on time.\nThere were 2 coding questions. Different sets had different questions. links to a few of them are as follows:\nQ1) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists/amp/\nQ2) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clone-linked-list-next-arbit-pointer-set-2/\nQ3) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/  \nQ4) https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/\nQ5) https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/\nRound -2(Technical Interview)\nQ1) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-number-can-expressed-sum-consecutive-numbers/\nThe solution given on the above link was not expected, but the interviewer was satisfied \nwith  O(n ^{ 0.5}) approach   \nQ2)https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-k-sum-paths-binary-tree/\nRound-3(Technical Interview)\nQ1)The idea was similar to the problem given in the link below, but the question was completely different.\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/painters-partition-problem/\nQ2)https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28871860/algorithm-to-find-the-maximum-non-adjacent-sum-in-n-ary-tree\nRound-4(Technical Interview)\nQ1)https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-steps-reach-target-knight/\nA lot of reasonings and variations(like, why BFS, can we do with DFS, if no then why?, its time and space complexity, can we do by using only O(1) memory to keep track of distance, etc ).  \nQ2)As the first question gulped the majority of the time because of its variations and reasoning, he told me that he would ask me a theoretical question.\nSo, first, he asked me to write down all the data structures which I know. And then, to think of real-time applications of each of them.  \nRound-5(Technical-cum-Managerial) \n1)https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-rotation-count-rotated-sorted-array/\n2)What would you do if you are stuck in a huge Technical problem? Support your answer with a realtime situation you have faced.\n3) Describe an incident where you were in a difficult situation(professional, not personal) first but then, finally came out of it successfully?\nAnd a few other \"Describe an incident\" Questions were also asked.\n Additional Information\nThe Interviews were conducted on Amazon Chime(A video calling platform).\nCoding questions were asked to code on Amazon's LiveCode platform where both the interviewer and the interviewee can simultaneously edit and view the code.\nThe Interviews were of 1 hr each.\n\nTips:\nBe thorough with  Time and space complexity calculation, as it is the first question you might get after proposing an algorithm to the interviewer.\nDon't be silent in the interview, keep sharing all your thoughts and budding ideas, it would not only engage the interviewer but also help you to get fresh ideas.\nBe polite and carefully listen to the interviewer(you might be lucky to grab a few clues).\nA big Thank you to GeeksforGeeks for transforming me from a reader to a writer.\n \nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAmazon Interview Experience | On-Campus for SDE-1"
