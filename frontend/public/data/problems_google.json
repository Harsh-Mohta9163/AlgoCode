        "content_summary": "Amazon WoW is an initiative which gives an opportunity to women students in their final or pre-final year to work at Amazon as an intern or full time employee. The process started with filling an application in Amazon WoW website, in the application basic info about college, branch, resume were to be submitted. After a few days based on the resume mail was sent regarding the round 1 test.\nThe test consisted of 28 MCQ's (C++, data structures etc.) and 2 Medium level coding questions.\nI was able to solve both the coding questions so I passed the round 1 test.\nRound 1 Technical interview:\nThe interview was online and took place on Amazon Chime platform. The interview started with my introduction and followed by his. After this he jumped straight into the coding questions.\nI was asked 2 coding questions:\nGiven a graph of n nodes and e edges.\n           Find the minimum number of edges that must be added to the graph to make it strongly connected.\n           Example:\n                  n=4, e=2\n                   [1,2]\n                   [3,4]\n                 Output: 1\n                 Here 1-->2 and 3-->4 are connected to make it strongly connected we need to join either 1-->4 or 2--->4 or 3-->1 or 2-->3\n            Approach: This can be done by finding number of strongly connected components using DFS. If there are N strongly connected components then the                          minimum  number of edges that must be added to the graph to make it strongly connected would be N-1.\n      2.   Minimum path sum    \nI was asked to tell the time complexity before writing the code. ( clean code in my preferred language)\nRound 2 Technical interview:\nThe interview started with my introduction and followed by his. After this he jumped straight into the coding questions.\nI was asked 2 coding questions:\nFlattening a linked list\nMerge k sorted arrays (priority queue approach)\nSome discussion on priority queue insertion time complexity was also done.\nRound 3 Technical interview:\nUsually Amazon internship have only 2 rounds but sometimes if they do not have enough data points on a candidate they conduct an additional round.\nSo I had this round 3.\nIn this round he asked me:\nConvert a sorted linked list into a balanced BST\nAn efficient data structure for searching, inserting and deleting.\nLot of discussion was done on the 2nd question. He was satisfied with Hashing method.\nFew DS, CN, OS questions were asked at the end.\nVerdict: Selected\nKnowing how to calculate time complexity is important. Staying confident, calm and focused throughout increases your chance of clearing the interview.\nThe secret of cracking an interview is Never Giving Up.\nPractice from GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode and any other coding platform with which you are comfortable.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAmazon Interview Experience | WoW 2020 (6 months Internship)"

        "content_summary": "  Round 1: Hangout Video call ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr )\nTell me something about yourself.\nThere is one marathon is happening. Each runner has unique no which is printed on his t-shirt. Cameraman is trying to capture that number from top so no is visible in 180 degree rotation. X  is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the digits  do not rotate to any other valid digit. Range is given and you need to find out good numbers lie within that range.\nCases:\n10 will be converted into 01 but not valid as our range start with 1. Prefix 0’s are not allowed.\nIf range is 1 to 7 and no 6 become  9 so it won’t allowed.\n11 won’t allow as 11 will become same after change.\nIf no has digits like 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 then that no won’t allow.\nInput: range: 1 to 10 (1 and 10 both are included)\nOutput: list of valid numbers: 6, 9\nYou can consider this  link for reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-given-number-is-fancy/ Round 2: On-site (Behavioural Round) ( 1 hr )\nTell me about yourself\nWhy Google?\nWhich product of Google you like most? Why? Any competing product in the market?\nIf I asked your current organization for feedback then what will they say? Focusing on negative point.\nIf you have to improve one technical and one behavioural point then which one will you improve?\nIn your last organization or before that any leadership work have you done? Mentorship / organizer type.\nWhat will you do when your work’s credit will be given to other person?\nAny situation when your manager didn’t agree with your idea and how did you convince him?\nWhy you are leaving before 1 year?\nWhat is your plan for 2 years in technical and non-technical aspects?\nDo you have any questions for me?\nRound 3: On site ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr ) She asked for binary search functionality which tells no exists in array or not. Generally we find mid element through (low+high)/ 2 so she asked to change that and use random function to decide mid. Binary search is performed on sorted array but here unsorted array is given. Two modifications are performed on binary search logic. 1) instead of sorted array, unsorted array has been given 2) Mid element is decided based on random function. Now we have to find out numbers from given array for which this function gives true result. Hint: Function will return true for value x, if all numbers on left side of x are small and all number on  the right side of x are greater.  Example: [ 4, 3, 1, 5, 7, 6, 10] Ans: 5, 10 Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n) Round 4: On site ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr ) One chocolate bar is given. There are n number of pieces in that bar. Each piece has its own sweetness level. You have to divide chocolate bar in k pieces and give those pieces to k-1 persons and you will get remaining last piece. You have to tell how much sweetness you will get. You will get least sweetness piece out of all k pieces. So you have to divide slab in such a way that you will get maximum sweetness. Input: 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9  N = 7, K = 4 Output: 7 (Divide it into 4 parts like [1, 2, 4] [7] [3, 6] [9] with sweetness level 7, 7, 9, 9 respectively) Links for reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/painters-partition-problem/ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/allocate-minimum-number-pages/ Round 5: On site ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr ) Similar to Round 4. There were n people each having some weight. You have to divide them in k continuous group such that total weight difference between groups will be minimised. You have to return difference between max and min weighted group. Input: 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9  N = 7, K = 4 Output: 2 (Divide it into 4 parts like [1, 2, 4] [7] [3, 6] [9] with weight 7, 7, 9, 9 respectively So answer will be 9 - 7) Round 6: On site ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr ) One grid is given. It contains characters in each cell. You have to find out the smallest hamilton distance between x to y. Hamilton Distance:  | row_index_x - row_index_y | + | column_index_x - column_index_y |  [ x, 0, 0, 0 ] [ 0, y, 0, y ] [ x, x, 0, 0 ] [ 0, y, 0, 0 ]  Ans: 1 Time Complexity: O(n x m) Space Complexity: O(n x m) Google mainly focuses on logic and how you are coming with solution. It notes down each and every small mistake. Interviewers are really very helpful. They expects clear code with optimal approach.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nGoogle Interview experience For SDE-1"

        "content_summary": "Amazon WoW is an initiative which gives an opportunity to women students in their final or pre-final year to work at Amazon as an intern or full time employee. The process started with filling an application in Amazon WoW website, in the application basic info about college, branch, resume were to be submitted. After a few days based on the resume mail was sent regarding the round 1 test.\nThe test consisted of 28 MCQ's (C++, data structures etc.) and 2 Medium level coding questions.\nI was able to solve both the coding questions so I passed the round 1 test.\nRound 1 Technical interview:\nThe interview was online and took place on Amazon Chime platform. The interview started with my introduction and followed by his. After this he jumped straight into the coding questions.\nI was asked 2 coding questions:\nGiven a graph of n nodes and e edges.\n           Find the minimum number of edges that must be added to the graph to make it strongly connected.\n           Example:\n                  n=4, e=2\n                   [1,2]\n                   [3,4]\n                 Output: 1\n                 Here 1-->2 and 3-->4 are connected to make it strongly connected we need to join either 1-->4 or 2--->4 or 3-->1 or 2-->3\n            Approach: This can be done by finding number of strongly connected components using DFS. If there are N strongly connected components then the                          minimum  number of edges that must be added to the graph to make it strongly connected would be N-1.\n      2.   Minimum path sum    \nI was asked to tell the time complexity before writing the code. ( clean code in my preferred language)\nRound 2 Technical interview:\nThe interview started with my introduction and followed by his. After this he jumped straight into the coding questions.\nI was asked 2 coding questions:\nFlattening a linked list\nMerge k sorted arrays (priority queue approach)\nSome discussion on priority queue insertion time complexity was also done.\nRound 3 Technical interview:\nUsually Amazon internship have only 2 rounds but sometimes if they do not have enough data points on a candidate they conduct an additional round.\nSo I had this round 3.\nIn this round he asked me:\nConvert a sorted linked list into a balanced BST\nAn efficient data structure for searching, inserting and deleting.\nLot of discussion was done on the 2nd question. He was satisfied with Hashing method.\nFew DS, CN, OS questions were asked at the end.\nVerdict: Selected\nKnowing how to calculate time complexity is important. Staying confident, calm and focused throughout increases your chance of clearing the interview.\nThe secret of cracking an interview is Never Giving Up.\nPractice from GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode and any other coding platform with which you are comfortable.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAmazon Interview Experience | WoW 2020 (6 months Internship)"

Therefore, this array satisfy the condition.\nYour task:\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isFrequencyUnique() which take integer N and array arr of size N as arguments, and returns a boolean.\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N)\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(N)\nConstraints:\n1 <= N <=105\n-109 <= arr[i] <= 109"

        "content_summary": "  Round 1: Hangout Video call ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr )\nTell me something about yourself.\nThere is one marathon is happening. Each runner has unique no which is printed on his t-shirt. Cameraman is trying to capture that number from top so no is visible in 180 degree rotation. X  is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the digits  do not rotate to any other valid digit. Range is given and you need to find out good numbers lie within that range.\nCases:\n10 will be converted into 01 but not valid as our range start with 1. Prefix 0’s are not allowed.\nIf range is 1 to 7 and no 6 become  9 so it won’t allowed.\n11 won’t allow as 11 will become same after change.\nIf no has digits like 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 then that no won’t allow.\nInput: range: 1 to 10 (1 and 10 both are included)\nOutput: list of valid numbers: 6, 9\nYou can consider this  link for reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-given-number-is-fancy/ Round 2: On-site (Behavioural Round) ( 1 hr )\nTell me about yourself\nWhy Google?\nWhich product of Google you like most? Why? Any competing product in the market?\nIf I asked your current organization for feedback then what will they say? Focusing on negative point.\nIf you have to improve one technical and one behavioural point then which one will you improve?\nIn your last organization or before that any leadership work have you done? Mentorship / organizer type.\nWhat will you do when your work’s credit will be given to other person?\nAny situation when your manager didn’t agree with your idea and how did you convince him?\nWhy you are leaving before 1 year?\nWhat is your plan for 2 years in technical and non-technical aspects?\nDo you have any questions for me?\nRound 3: On site ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr ) She asked for binary search functionality which tells no exists in array or not. Generally we find mid element through (low+high)/ 2 so she asked to change that and use random function to decide mid. Binary search is performed on sorted array but here unsorted array is given. Two modifications are performed on binary search logic. 1) instead of sorted array, unsorted array has been given 2) Mid element is decided based on random function. Now we have to find out numbers from given array for which this function gives true result. Hint: Function will return true for value x, if all numbers on left side of x are small and all number on  the right side of x are greater.  Example: [ 4, 3, 1, 5, 7, 6, 10] Ans: 5, 10 Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n) Round 4: On site ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr ) One chocolate bar is given. There are n number of pieces in that bar. Each piece has its own sweetness level. You have to divide chocolate bar in k pieces and give those pieces to k-1 persons and you will get remaining last piece. You have to tell how much sweetness you will get. You will get least sweetness piece out of all k pieces. So you have to divide slab in such a way that you will get maximum sweetness. Input: 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9  N = 7, K = 4 Output: 7 (Divide it into 4 parts like [1, 2, 4] [7] [3, 6] [9] with sweetness level 7, 7, 9, 9 respectively) Links for reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/painters-partition-problem/ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/allocate-minimum-number-pages/ Round 5: On site ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr ) Similar to Round 4. There were n people each having some weight. You have to divide them in k continuous group such that total weight difference between groups will be minimised. You have to return difference between max and min weighted group. Input: 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9  N = 7, K = 4 Output: 2 (Divide it into 4 parts like [1, 2, 4] [7] [3, 6] [9] with weight 7, 7, 9, 9 respectively So answer will be 9 - 7) Round 6: On site ( DS & Algo) ( 1 hr ) One grid is given. It contains characters in each cell. You have to find out the smallest hamilton distance between x to y. Hamilton Distance:  | row_index_x - row_index_y | + | column_index_x - column_index_y |  [ x, 0, 0, 0 ] [ 0, y, 0, y ] [ x, x, 0, 0 ] [ 0, y, 0, 0 ]  Ans: 1 Time Complexity: O(n x m) Space Complexity: O(n x m) Google mainly focuses on logic and how you are coming with solution. It notes down each and every small mistake. Interviewers are really very helpful. They expects clear code with optimal approach.\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nGoogle Interview experience For SDE-1"
