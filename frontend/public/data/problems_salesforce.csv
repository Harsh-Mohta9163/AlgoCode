"[{'title': 'Ola Interview Experience Set 7 For Sde 1', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ola-interview-experience-set-7-for-sde-1/', 'content_summary': ""I was recently interviewed by OLA, I could not make it after the last round. All rounds I had were telephonic, in the last round I was asked to code on collabedit. Round 1 (around 35 min): 1. Given a matrix containing 0's and 1's. Find all the rows which are having 1's at same position. Give all sets satisfying this. 2. In a stock market given are price of shares spread over a week. On what day should I buy and what day should i sell to get maximum profit. 3. Being a computer engineer why did I not opt for system side programming than web domain. (I had expr in web domain) 4. I had expr in web domain so he asked: What is the difference between web browser request and ajax call request. -- It is simple, by ajax call partial web page can be loaded. 5. Have you worked on ruby on rails? Round 2 : 1. Given a matrix containing numbers. Find the 0's and make all the rows and columns corresponding to that index as 0. 2. Design a structure for a File Uploader service (eg. Dropbox, google drive). It is a service where multiple people can upload data at the same time and it also lists the top five uploaders (who uploaded the maximum number of files). 3. Puzzle: There is an employer and a worker, the employer has a gold bar of 7 units and he has to give 1unit each on a day for 7 days. The employer has a magical knife which doesn't work once it performs two cuts(1 cut divides the bar into two parts) on the bar. How will you cut so that 1 unit on each day can be given to the worker. 4. Print left view of binary tree. Round 3 : 1. He discussed what things they work on Ola. How these things are implemented. Like he mentioned of bar code a product has and catalog kind of thing. 2. I had to explain what project I am working on currently, what is the team size. 3. a)Since I had worked on SQL and databases, so he asked me what data structure will I use to implement a database. --I gave hashmap as a soln (the key is our primary key and other fields we can store in an object which will be value for hashmap) b)Now, If in case you want to find all names starting with a particular word (eg. ram....).How will you do that? -- gave trie structure as soln. c)Now you need to find students whose marks are between a range i.e. between two numbers. How will you do, what data structure will you take in this case? -- a simple solution was that, take binary search tree and do inorder traversal of that (I couldn't answer this, not clicked me) 4. Do you want to ask anything? Round 4 : 1. The server receives a ping every 30 secs. The ping is load avg on the machine at that time. Find 90% percentile of the load average on the machine at any time instant. 2. Find missing number in an AP.\nRelated Practice Problems\nStock buy and sell\nMaximum Difference\nAll Practice Problems for Ola-Cabs !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nOLA Interview Experience | Set 7 (For SDE-1)""}, {'title': 'Accolite Interview Experience Set 4 On Campus', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/accolite-interview-experience-set-4-on-campus/', 'content_summary': ""Round 1 (Written) \nAround 140 students appeared for the offline test. \n\n\nThere were 20 MCQs that to be done in (30 minutes), questions were from OS,DBMS,Datastructures. \nAfter that coding round was there (paper coding) in which 3 questions were given and we have to attempt any 2 (1 hour) \n\n1. Write your own sqrt() function. the function should return square root if it is a perfect square else return floor(sqrt(x)) \n2. Given an array containing positive and negative integers. you have to find the smallest missing positive number. your code should run in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n3. Given an array of strings, find whether the strings can be chained or not to form a circle. A string x can be put before another string y if last character of x is same as first character of y. \n\nAfter round-1 , 19 people were shortlisted for the interviews. \n\n\n\n\nRound 2 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. Tell me about yourself. Meanwhile he(interviewer) looked into my CV and asked about my projects. \nI have done 3 projects so he started discussion CUDA and parallel programming and how you implemented over images to detect edges and how much gain factor achieved. \nsecondly,I have made an project on online voting system so he asked me to draw E-R diagram, schemas and the relationship between them and their functionalities.About (25-30) minutes discussion. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth smallest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n\n3. Suppose you have server where multiple requests are coming at time to,t1,t2...Now suppose a user hits at any particular time t on the server then server should return the last request. you have to design the datastructure for the same. \nI suggested that we can use stack that will return the last request, he then asked me to do for last 10 requests then I suggested to use array of structures which will store request no. and timestamp along with them.Now at any time t we can move 10 elements back but he said that suppose user hits frequently then every time i will have to traverse back again and again so time complexity will be much high, I agreed and suggested another solution similar to LRU implementation so that the requests which are coming frequently can be processed faster. then he modified question that user wants requests of last 1 minute and he gave a hint that is it necessary to store all requests can we not just store requests of every 1 min only,then suddenly it clicked to me, I suggested to use deque for 60 secs now suppose request arrives at 61st sec then we can just add that at rear and remove one from front maintaining a window of 60 seconds.He was satisfied but he want that no deletion should be there so I told him to use circular deque so that we can replace previous elements.He was completely satisfied now with the approach.(About 35 min. discussion) \n\n4. Given an array containing prices of a share of 30 days.A person has 1 share which he can buy and sell any number of times, you have to find the maximum profit which can be earned. \nI suggested one approach to create two auxiliary array MIN from left and MAX from right and traverse both simultaneously if difference between MAX[i] and MIN[i] is greater than maxDiff then update maxDIff and store current index and add to sum if index+1 is not equal to current iteration index and finally return sum.He tried some test cases over my code and found that for some cases it was giving wrong answer,then he asked me that how is my command over dynamic programming,I told I know only the standard ones and no other experience,then he said this question is of DP but he was happy to see my approach.(About 20-25 min.) \n\n\n\n\nRound 3 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. She(interviewer) asked me if I attempted 3rd question in written test, I said I attempted only 1st and 2nd, then she gave me paper and told to implement the 3rd question. \nI suggested an approach to use two arrays of structures(for first characters and last characters) which will contain boolean value to mark presence of character in string and also its index. Now compare two arrays and see that if both arrays have same boolean value and different indices for all first and last characters. If so then strings can form a chain else not.She was in doubt for my solution so she found a testcase where my code was giving wrong answer,so she told me to look for another solution,I came up with another approach and told her that we can make a directed graph from first and last characters and then traverse it in DFS, now suppose if the visited node is visited again and count of total visited nodes is same as total nodes then we can say that strings will form a chain, now she was satisfied with approach and asked me to write code, now as my graph was weak i was in shock,so she said to just write the pseudocode. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth largest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nI suggested to declare a static variable count which will increment count if node visited in inorder and if count becomes k, I will print that node's data and return. Then she asked me how static works and difference between global and static. \n\n3. Given a mobile keypad of say nokia phone and a dictionary which has all the meaningful words which can be formed, suppose now user types some number(input) then your program must suggest all the meaningful words which are present in dictionary.Before implementing this she asked me the datastructure to store the dictionary efficiently and then how will you use this datastructure to make code. \nAt first, I suggested I will store dictionary in 2-D array and lexicograpphically sort it, now suppose user types a number the string starting with that character is searched in the array. she said to reduce complexity because dictionary may contain 1000s of words,then I suggested to use trie datastructure to store and search the string, she was satisfied now and asked me to explain the concept. \n4.Given preorder and postorder of a graph, how can you construct the graph. \nAs I heard this question, i was stuck for 2 minutes but then I said as far as graph is concerned I dont know about it but a unique tree cannot be constructed with preorder and postorder so as graph,so inorder is needed, she was happy and agreed on answer. \n\n\n\n\nRound 4 (Technical) (2:30 hr) \n1. Suppose a linked list is given and there is a loop, you have to find orphan nodes in O(n) time. orphan nodes are the nodes outside the loop. \n\n2. Design a BRTS traffic signalling system such that no two vehicle clashes. Note that BRTS bus will follow the BRTS traffic lights B1,B2,B3,B4 in 4 directions and regular traffic will follow regular traffic lights R1,R2,R3,R4 only. In input only maximum cycle time was given(time after which the process repeates) check for all corner cases (traffic lights have two states only (RED and GREEN)).you have to tell any one possible combination of traffic lights under maximum cycle time. (About 1hr discussion). \n\n3. Suppose a linked list is given but we dont know the count of nodes, you have to find the kth node from last without counting the nodes. \n4. Given an array of n integers such some elements are in the range 0 to n-1 and some out of range may be negative.You have to rearrange array such that all elements which are in range appear on their index and rest appear in sorted manner for indexes not present.This should be done in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nEg- suppose n=6 ,4 5 2 3 6 -3 output= -3,6,2,3,4,5 \n\n5. How can you implement stack using queue/queues. \n6. How can you sort the elements with the help of queue. \nI suggested one O(n) time solution along with O(n) extra space.He asked to do in O(1) space so I suggested deque, he seemed satisfied. \n\nonly 4 were selected till this round (I was one of them) \n\nRound 5 (Bar Raiser) (30 minutes) \n\n1. find the length of longest palindrome in a string starting from index 0. \n2. find if a string A is present in string B or not. \n3. find the length of longest prefix in a string \n\nAfter this 2 were selected finally and unfortunately I was not amongst them as they might have thought i was little stress out. At last I would suggest that your approach and concepts must be strong as they always give questions with some variations. \n\nRelated Practice ProblemsSmallest Positive missing numberCount SquaresCircle of stringsCheck for subsequenceStock buy and sellLongest Palindrome in a String\n\n \n\n\nAll Practice Problems for Accolite ! \n\n\n \n \nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nAccolite Interview Experience | Set 4 (On-Campus)""}, {'title': 'One97paytm Interview Experience', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/one97paytm-interview-experience/', 'content_summary': 'Written 1: Technical and Aptitude.

Platform used for the test was of makemytrip and slightly difficult to understand. Question1: Calculate the power of a ^ b mod c using logn approach.The thing that was to be taken care of was that you did not needed to return or print your answer but you had to store it in their predefined global variable. You could easily find the solution on geeksforgeeks site. Question2: Given a sentence you were supposed to calculate the count of Capital , small letter and number.Question seemed to be quite easy but the pick was that you needed to store the answer in char* output variable in the form of c1:c2:c3 where c1 represent count of capital letter c2 represent count of small letter and c3 represent count of number. (Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,""%d:%d:%d"",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities . Determine the maximum number of non conflicting activities that you can achieve. (Hint : make a structure of start and finish time and sort according to finishing interval) I solved 2 completely and 1 partially Tip:Since they have only one sample test case so even you are not able to solve the coding question just store the hard coded answer in that variable.

Round 2: Personal Interview Since I was last candidate in that list waiting from 10:30 am My turn came at 10:30 PM.The interviewer was very cool and friendly.He started with asking tell me about yourself and what projects I have done.After half hour rigerous discussion over my project and making schema of databases I used in project He started asking question on ds. Question1: Sort a linklist consisting of 0,1,2\'s. (Hint: I used hashmap of stl in c++ to store the count of 0,1 and 2) Question 2: Given a stock You need to find the maximum profit you can earn .You are allowed to buy and sell as many number of time you can.) Question 3:Design a treeset in java. (Hint:I told him to use BST but he told to think of more optimized way so Ii told AVL and wrote functions for insertion in AVL tree) Question4:Diffrentiate between method overloading and method overriding.What are static blocks in java. Question5: Drilling question on deployment descriptor,struts,mysql. Round3: Personal Interview The interviewer seemed to be exhausted . He asked me that Since you are the last person so all the question you would have asked. So tell me what all question you have asked. I told him distinct palindromic substring in string, LIS, LCS etc students told that you are asking.He thought for a while and told me to write standard bfs code for graph traversal. Question2: You have been given a matrix of character and a dictionary.You need to find the valid words that you can obtain from it and print it. (Hint:I used dfs to find the valid sequence and assumed that all words are stored in a hashmap) After these He asked 6 puzzles to be solved in a given time. Puzzle 1 : 1.5 hen give 1.5 egg in 1.5 day. How many hens are required to have 4 dozen of egg in 6 days. Puzzle 2: 2 ropes and take 1hr to burn. Calculate 45 min Puzzle 3:10 jar with 10gm marble in each jar.One jar contain 9gm marbles only.Find the defective jar in one turn. Puzzle4:150 person are standing in a queue in sorted order.A blind person comes and wants to be at right position in queue.So he asks any person whether he can stand in front of him.He will reply in Yes or No . You have to find the right place after 2Yes. Give a strategy to find the correct place. (Hint:This puzzle can be reduced to egg drop puzzle) Puzzle 5:25 horse having race find top 3 Puzzle 6:A person is riding a car and he sees a milestone A. After 1hr he sees milestone B which has digits reversed of A.After one hour more he finds a milestone C which contains all the digits of A and B . Given that A < B < C find the speed of car. (Other question that were asked from my friend 1.Distinct Palindrome in string 2.Transaction minimize problem 3.LCS and LIS (dp approach) 4.Diameter of tree 5.Pattern Matching Algorithm (KMP)) HR round: He asked me about my family background,what I do ,hobbies.What I know about makemytrip.What location I would prefer , whether I am satisfied with package or not,Working environment etc, It lasted for half hour.

Round 5 (Hr): Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation? just a casual talk. Note: All rounds, you need to explain about your project clearly and they can ask some really good questions from your project. Be out and out clear with your projects and CV. After this, I was actually into my Dream Company and Happy..!! I suggest that always listen carefully to an interviewer, they’ll definitely help if you have any doubt. Tell them your approach at least if you are not able to code it. Practice writing code on paper. For Qualcomm Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings and Trees are concepts which are very generally asked.

Later he introduced himself and asked the same.\nComing to technical questions, he asked me the algorithm and also asked me to code both this and this. Discussed the time complexities and edge cases. \nThen he gave me the last 5 mins to ask any questions to him.\n2nd Round: This round started without any introduction, and he directly jumped into the question. Asked me about the algorithm, and later coded it and ran it. And then he asked me to optimize it. Finally, he asked me if I had any questions.\n3rd Round: This was the last round of the day. He introduced himself and asked how I reduced API response times(which I mentioned in my resume). We discussed it for 5-10 min. Then he asked about the project(can't share those details here) which I worked on in my prev company. Discussed use cases and complete design of the implementation. Then, he asked me a question which is similar to System Design. Finally, he asked me if I had any questions.\nAfter these 3 interviews, that night, HR called and informed me that I was selected for the 4th and final round. He scheduled a meeting for 4 days later.\nFinal Round: He started off by asking me to open my mobile phone and told me to open any messaging application and type something. Then, he pointed out to look at the suggestions after and while typing a word. Then, he asked me to design that functionality for a newly bought mobile. There are multiple ways to do it using Tries and Ternary Search Tree, we discussed some of them and one in-depth. Later, he asked me about Distributed File Systems and why and when they are used. And also about how the Single Point of Failure issue handled. By this time almost 50 min was completed. Then, he asked me to write the code for Sudoku solver. I explained the algorithm and gave a walkthrough, and he was convinced. But, when I ran it the test cases were not passing due to a very small bug.

I was not able to answer almost all the answers correctly but gave almost 75% correct answers. The interviewer mainly focused on the problem-solving ability and the quality of conceptual knowledge. We were judged on 5 criteria in all the technical Interviews- DSA, Coding, Puzzles, Testing Questions and Operating system. 1: Basic Introductory Questions 2: 2-3 Puzzle Questions which we can easily find on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/ i: You have a birthday cake and have to cut it into 8 equal pieces by making 3 cuts only. How do you do it? ii: You are standing before two doors. One of the paths leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you don’t know who the honest one is and who the liar is.You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question? 3: Some basic Questions on DSA- about stacks, queue, arrays, memory storage accessing, Advantages and Dis of the Linked list over arrays, 4: Operating System: In all the rounds, Operating System questions were asked in abundance. Though the questions were basic, they focused more on our concepts like how easily we were able to explain it to them. Questions on Kernels, Types of Kernel, Why OS, memory allocation in OS were asked. 5: Test Cases Question: We have to think and answer the possible questions while testing the cases. i: Test cases for a login page window. 6: Heavy discussions on the projects I have done. Why we preferred to use a particular technology. What was my role in the project and so on. 7: I was asked to code some questions. i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1 ii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-second-largest-element2406/1 iii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-loop-in-linked-list/1 After a wait of about 15 minutes, I was called for my second round of Interview.  \nFourth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 2\nThis round of interview was taken by a senior person of the company. It was a bit lengthy as we had more of a discussion rather than just a QnA round. The interview went for more than 90 minutes and was tougher than the first round. 1: There was a long discussion on what I have written in my resume. The projects I had done, Extracurricular and co-curricular activities I had written on the resume, the skills I have mentioned. All of it. So be careful of whatever you mention in the resume. 2: Next he asked me a bunch of coding questions which were some very popular ones i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/anagram-1587115620/1 ii: Implementation of Merge Sort https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/ iii: Implementing Queue using stacks and Stack using queues. iv:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-repeated-character4108/1 I was asked to code in my preferred language. So there wasn’t any language barrier and for all the questions the interviewer asked for the most optimized approach. As I was able to answer all the questions, I wasn’t asked any more questions. 3: After the coding questions, I was asked a lot of questions about Operation System and OOPS. i:   Fragmentation- Internal and External ii:  Concepts of Kernel iii:  File Management iv:  Virtual functions and Friend Functions v:  Function Overloading And Overriding vi: What is paging and Demand Paging? 4: Interview puzzles: i: The mislabeled Jar puzzle https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-mislabeled-jars/ ii: Maximize probability of White Ball https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-12-maximize-probability-of-white-ball/ iii:  100 Prisoners with Red/Black Hats https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-13-100-prisoners-with-redblack-hats/ 5:  Testing Based Questions- i: Five new inventions in a glass frame and the test cases to test the working a frame. ii: Design test cases for a shopping application. The interviewer was quite satisfied with the test cases I answered. As the main trick to solve these kinds of interview questions is to design the test cases by giving every small function an eye and then forming all possible scenarios for the same.  \nFifth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 3 + MANAGERIAL ROUND\n  This was also similar to the last two Technical Interviews and was also easier from them. The interview went for about 70 minutes and It was tilted more towards the managerial side and less Technical was asked. 1: Program to Count set bits in an integer. (I answered 4 possible solutions to him and he was satisfied)  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-bits0143/1 2: Working of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort ( I was asked to dry run the solution mainly to check the internal working of swapping and comparison) 3: Torch and Bridge https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/ 4:  Some Mathematical Puzzles 5: Design test cases for OLA Application 6: Design test cases for GMAIL Application 7: Situation based questions 8: What is a Semaphore and operations on a semaphore? 9: What is context switching?  \nSixth Round - HR INTERVIEW\nIt was the last round and an eliminatory round as well.  The interviewer was pretty cool. After the introduction, I was asked questions like where are you from? What is special about you?  Why should we select you? Which was your favorite subject last semester? Which Adobe products you liked the most and why? It was a 20 minutes long discussion round about college life, interests, and hobbies. The HR also asked our preferred joining location between Noida and Bangalore which gave us many hopes of our selection. Three candidates from our college went to the HR Round. Two days later we received the confirmation mail that two students are selected.

All rounds I had were telephonic, in the last round I was asked to code on collabedit. Round 1 (around 35 min): 1. Given a matrix containing 0's and 1's. Find all the rows which are having 1's at same position. Give all sets satisfying this. 2. In a stock market given are price of shares spread over a week. On what day should I buy and what day should i sell to get maximum profit. 3. Being a computer engineer why did I not opt for system side programming than web domain. (I had expr in web domain) 4. I had expr in web domain so he asked: What is the difference between web browser request and ajax call request. -- It is simple, by ajax call partial web page can be loaded. 5. Have you worked on ruby on rails? Round 2 : 1. Given a matrix containing numbers. Find the 0's and make all the rows and columns corresponding to that index as 0. 2. Design a structure for a File Uploader service (eg. Dropbox, google drive). It is a service where multiple people can upload data at the same time and it also lists the top five uploaders (who uploaded the maximum number of files). 3. Puzzle: There is an employer and a worker, the employer has a gold bar of 7 units and he has to give 1unit each on a day for 7 days. The employer has a magical knife which doesn't work once it performs two cuts(1 cut divides the bar into two parts) on the bar. How will you cut so that 1 unit on each day can be given to the worker. 4. Print left view of binary tree. Round 3 : 1. He discussed what things they work on Ola. How these things are implemented. Like he mentioned of bar code a product has and catalog kind of thing. 2. I had to explain what project I am working on currently, what is the team size. 3. a)Since I had worked on SQL and databases, so he asked me what data structure will I use to implement a database. --I gave hashmap as a soln (the key is our primary key and other fields we can store in an object which will be value for hashmap) b)Now, If in case you want to find all names starting with a particular word (eg. ram....).How will you do that? -- gave trie structure as soln. c)Now you need to find students whose marks are between a range i.e. between two numbers. How will you do, what data structure will you take in this case? -- a simple solution was that, take binary search tree and do inorder traversal of that (I couldn't answer this, not clicked me) 4. Do you want to ask anything? Round 4 : 1. The server receives a ping every 30 secs. The ping is load avg on the machine at that time. Find 90% percentile of the load average on the machine at any time instant. 2. Find missing number in an AP.\nRelated Practice Problems\nStock buy and sell\nMaximum Difference\nAll Practice Problems for Ola-Cabs !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nOLA Interview Experience | Set 7 (For SDE-1)""}, {'title': 'Accolite Interview Experience Set 4 On Campus', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/accolite-interview-experience-set-4-on-campus/', 'content_summary': ""Round 1 (Written) \nAround 140 students appeared for the offline test. \n\n\nThere were 20 MCQs that to be done in (30 minutes), questions were from OS,DBMS,Datastructures. \nAfter that coding round was there (paper coding) in which 3 questions were given and we have to attempt any 2 (1 hour) \n\n1. Write your own sqrt() function. the function should return square root if it is a perfect square else return floor(sqrt(x)) \n2. Given an array containing positive and negative integers. you have to find the smallest missing positive number. your code should run in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n3. Given an array of strings, find whether the strings can be chained or not to form a circle. A string x can be put before another string y if last character of x is same as first character of y. \n\nAfter round-1 , 19 people were shortlisted for the interviews. \n\n\n\n\nRound 2 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. Tell me about yourself. Meanwhile he(interviewer) looked into my CV and asked about my projects. \nI have done 3 projects so he started discussion CUDA and parallel programming and how you implemented over images to detect edges and how much gain factor achieved. \nsecondly,I have made an project on online voting system so he asked me to draw E-R diagram, schemas and the relationship between them and their functionalities.About (25-30) minutes discussion. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth smallest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n\n3. Suppose you have server where multiple requests are coming at time to,t1,t2...Now suppose a user hits at any particular time t on the server then server should return the last request. you have to design the datastructure for the same. \nI suggested that we can use stack that will return the last request, he then asked me to do for last 10 requests then I suggested to use array of structures which will store request no. and timestamp along with them.Now at any time t we can move 10 elements back but he said that suppose user hits frequently then every time i will have to traverse back again and again so time complexity will be much high, I agreed and suggested another solution similar to LRU implementation so that the requests which are coming frequently can be processed faster. then he modified question that user wants requests of last 1 minute and he gave a hint that is it necessary to store all requests can we not just store requests of every 1 min only,then suddenly it clicked to me, I suggested to use deque for 60 secs now suppose request arrives at 61st sec then we can just add that at rear and remove one from front maintaining a window of 60 seconds.He was satisfied but he want that no deletion should be there so I told him to use circular deque so that we can replace previous elements.He was completely satisfied now with the approach.(About 35 min. discussion) \n\n4. Given an array containing prices of a share of 30 days.A person has 1 share which he can buy and sell any number of times, you have to find the maximum profit which can be earned. \nI suggested one approach to create two auxiliary array MIN from left and MAX from right and traverse both simultaneously if difference between MAX[i] and MIN[i] is greater than maxDiff then update maxDIff and store current index and add to sum if index+1 is not equal to current iteration index and finally return sum.He tried some test cases over my code and found that for some cases it was giving wrong answer,then he asked me that how is my command over dynamic programming,I told I know only the standard ones and no other experience,then he said this question is of DP but he was happy to see my approach.(About 20-25 min.) \n\n\n\n\nRound 3 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. She(interviewer) asked me if I attempted 3rd question in written test, I said I attempted only 1st and 2nd, then she gave me paper and told to implement the 3rd question. \nI suggested an approach to use two arrays of structures(for first characters and last characters) which will contain boolean value to mark presence of character in string and also its index. Now compare two arrays and see that if both arrays have same boolean value and different indices for all first and last characters. If so then strings can form a chain else not.She was in doubt for my solution so she found a testcase where my code was giving wrong answer,so she told me to look for another solution,I came up with another approach and told her that we can make a directed graph from first and last characters and then traverse it in DFS, now suppose if the visited node is visited again and count of total visited nodes is same as total nodes then we can say that strings will form a chain, now she was satisfied with approach and asked me to write code, now as my graph was weak i was in shock,so she said to just write the pseudocode. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth largest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nI suggested to declare a static variable count which will increment count if node visited in inorder and if count becomes k, I will print that node's data and return. Then she asked me how static works and difference between global and static. \n\n3. Given a mobile keypad of say nokia phone and a dictionary which has all the meaningful words which can be formed, suppose now user types some number(input) then your program must suggest all the meaningful words which are present in dictionary.Before implementing this she asked me the datastructure to store the dictionary efficiently and then how will you use this datastructure to make code. \nAt first, I suggested I will store dictionary in 2-D array and lexicograpphically sort it, now suppose user types a number the string starting with that character is searched in the array. she said to reduce complexity because dictionary may contain 1000s of words,then I suggested to use trie datastructure to store and search the string, she was satisfied now and asked me to explain the concept. \n4.Given preorder and postorder of a graph, how can you construct the graph. \nAs I heard this question, i was stuck for 2 minutes but then I said as far as graph is concerned I dont know about it but a unique tree cannot be constructed with preorder and postorder so as graph,so inorder is needed, she was happy and agreed on answer. \n\n\n\n\nRound 4 (Technical) (2:30 hr) \n1. Suppose a linked list is given and there is a loop, you have to find orphan nodes in O(n) time. orphan nodes are the nodes outside the loop. \n\n2. Design a BRTS traffic signalling system such that no two vehicle clashes. Note that BRTS bus will follow the BRTS traffic lights B1,B2,B3,B4 in 4 directions and regular traffic will follow regular traffic lights R1,R2,R3,R4 only. In input only maximum cycle time was given(time after which the process repeates) check for all corner cases (traffic lights have two states only (RED and GREEN)).you have to tell any one possible combination of traffic lights under maximum cycle time. (About 1hr discussion). \n\n3. Suppose a linked list is given but we dont know the count of nodes, you have to find the kth node from last without counting the nodes. \n4. Given an array of n integers such some elements are in the range 0 to n-1 and some out of range may be negative.You have to rearrange array such that all elements which are in range appear on their index and rest appear in sorted manner for indexes not present.This should be done in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nEg- suppose n=6 ,4 5 2 3 6 -3 output= -3,6,2,3,4,5 \n\n5. How can you implement stack using queue/queues. \n6. How can you sort the elements with the help of queue. \nI suggested one O(n) time solution along with O(n) extra space.He asked to do in O(1) space so I suggested deque, he seemed satisfied. \n\nonly 4 were selected till this round (I was one of them) \n\nRound 5 (Bar Raiser) (30 minutes) \n\n1. find the length of longest palindrome in a string starting from index 0. \n2. find if a string A is present in string B or not. \n3. find the length of longest prefix in a string \n\nAfter this 2 were selected finally and unfortunately I was not amongst them as they might have thought i was little stress out.

(Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,""%d:%d:%d"",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities . Determine the maximum number of non conflicting activities that you can achieve. (Hint : make a structure of start and finish time and sort according to finishing interval) I solved 2 completely and 1 partially Tip:Since they have only one sample test case so even you are not able to solve the coding question just store the hard coded answer in that variable. I did that in last :P) Out of 110 students 30 students got selected for Personal Interview round. Round 2: Personal Interview Since I was last candidate in that list waiting from 10:30 am My turn came at 10:30 PM.The interviewer was very cool and friendly.He started with asking tell me about yourself and what projects I have done.After half hour rigerous discussion over my project and making schema of databases I used in project He started asking question on ds. Question1: Sort a linklist consisting of 0,1,2\'s. (Hint: I used hashmap of stl in c++ to store the count of 0,1 and 2) Question 2: Given a stock You need to find the maximum profit you can earn .You are allowed to buy and sell as many number of time you can.) Question 3:Design a treeset in java. (Hint:I told him to use BST but he told to think of more optimized way so Ii told AVL and wrote functions for insertion in AVL tree) Question4:Diffrentiate between method overloading and method overriding.What are static blocks in java. Question5: Drilling question on deployment descriptor,struts,mysql. Round3: Personal Interview The interviewer seemed to be exhausted . He asked me that Since you are the last person so all the question you would have asked. So tell me what all question you have asked. I told him distinct palindromic substring in string, LIS, LCS etc students told that you are asking.He thought for a while and told me to write standard bfs code for graph traversal. Question2: You have been given a matrix of character and a dictionary.You need to find the valid words that you can obtain from it and print it. (Hint:I used dfs to find the valid sequence and assumed that all words are stored in a hashmap) After these He asked 6 puzzles to be solved in a given time. Puzzle 1 : 1.5 hen give 1.5 egg in 1.5 day. How many hens are required to have 4 dozen of egg in 6 days. Puzzle 2: 2 ropes and take 1hr to burn. Calculate 45 min Puzzle 3:10 jar with 10gm marble in each jar.One jar contain 9gm marbles only.Find the defective jar in one turn. Puzzle4:150 person are standing in a queue in sorted order.A blind person comes and wants to be at right position in queue.So he asks any person whether he can stand in front of him.He will reply in Yes or No . You have to find the right place after 2Yes. Give a strategy to find the correct place. (Hint:This puzzle can be reduced to egg drop puzzle) Puzzle 5:25 horse having race find top 3 Puzzle 6:A person is riding a car and he sees a milestone A. After 1hr he sees milestone B which has digits reversed of A.After one hour more he finds a milestone C which contains all the digits of A and B . Given that A < B < C find the speed of car. (Other question that were asked from my friend 1.Distinct Palindrome in string 2.Transaction minimize problem 3.LCS and LIS (dp approach) 4.Diameter of tree 5.Pattern Matching Algorithm (KMP)) HR round: He asked me about my family background,what I do ,hobbies.What I know about makemytrip.What location I would prefer , whether I am satisfied with package or not,Working environment etc, It lasted for half hour.

All rounds I had were telephonic, in the last round I was asked to code on collabedit. Round 1 (around 35 min): 1. Given a matrix containing 0's and 1's. Find all the rows which are having 1's at same position. Give all sets satisfying this. 2. In a stock market given are price of shares spread over a week. On what day should I buy and what day should i sell to get maximum profit. 3. Being a computer engineer why did I not opt for system side programming than web domain. (I had expr in web domain) 4. I had expr in web domain so he asked: What is the difference between web browser request and ajax call request. -- It is simple, by ajax call partial web page can be loaded. 5. Have you worked on ruby on rails? Round 2 : 1. Given a matrix containing numbers. Find the 0's and make all the rows and columns corresponding to that index as 0. 2. Design a structure for a File Uploader service (eg. Dropbox, google drive). It is a service where multiple people can upload data at the same time and it also lists the top five uploaders (who uploaded the maximum number of files). 3. Puzzle: There is an employer and a worker, the employer has a gold bar of 7 units and he has to give 1unit each on a day for 7 days. The employer has a magical knife which doesn't work once it performs two cuts(1 cut divides the bar into two parts) on the bar. How will you cut so that 1 unit on each day can be given to the worker. 4. Print left view of binary tree. Round 3 : 1. He discussed what things they work on Ola. How these things are implemented. Like he mentioned of bar code a product has and catalog kind of thing. 2. I had to explain what project I am working on currently, what is the team size. 3. a)Since I had worked on SQL and databases, so he asked me what data structure will I use to implement a database. --I gave hashmap as a soln (the key is our primary key and other fields we can store in an object which will be value for hashmap) b)Now, If in case you want to find all names starting with a particular word (eg. ram....).How will you do that? -- gave trie structure as soln. c)Now you need to find students whose marks are between a range i.e. between two numbers. How will you do, what data structure will you take in this case? -- a simple solution was that, take binary search tree and do inorder traversal of that (I couldn't answer this, not clicked me) 4. Do you want to ask anything? Round 4 : 1. The server receives a ping every 30 secs. The ping is load avg on the machine at that time. Find 90% percentile of the load average on the machine at any time instant. 2.

Write your own sqrt() function. the function should return square root if it is a perfect square else return floor(sqrt(x)) \n2. Given an array containing positive and negative integers. you have to find the smallest missing positive number. your code should run in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n3. Given an array of strings, find whether the strings can be chained or not to form a circle. A string x can be put before another string y if last character of x is same as first character of y. \n\nAfter round-1 , 19 people were shortlisted for the interviews. \n\n\n\n\nRound 2 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. Tell me about yourself. Meanwhile he(interviewer) looked into my CV and asked about my projects. \nI have done 3 projects so he started discussion CUDA and parallel programming and how you implemented over images to detect edges and how much gain factor achieved. \nsecondly,I have made an project on online voting system so he asked me to draw E-R diagram, schemas and the relationship between them and their functionalities.About (25-30) minutes discussion. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth smallest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n\n3. Suppose you have server where multiple requests are coming at time to,t1,t2...Now suppose a user hits at any particular time t on the server then server should return the last request. you have to design the datastructure for the same. \nI suggested that we can use stack that will return the last request, he then asked me to do for last 10 requests then I suggested to use array of structures which will store request no. and timestamp along with them.Now at any time t we can move 10 elements back but he said that suppose user hits frequently then every time i will have to traverse back again and again so time complexity will be much high, I agreed and suggested another solution similar to LRU implementation so that the requests which are coming frequently can be processed faster. then he modified question that user wants requests of last 1 minute and he gave a hint that is it necessary to store all requests can we not just store requests of every 1 min only,then suddenly it clicked to me, I suggested to use deque for 60 secs now suppose request arrives at 61st sec then we can just add that at rear and remove one from front maintaining a window of 60 seconds.He was satisfied but he want that no deletion should be there so I told him to use circular deque so that we can replace previous elements.He was completely satisfied now with the approach.(About 35 min. discussion) \n\n4. Given an array containing prices of a share of 30 days.A person has 1 share which he can buy and sell any number of times, you have to find the maximum profit which can be earned. \nI suggested one approach to create two auxiliary array MIN from left and MAX from right and traverse both simultaneously if difference between MAX[i] and MIN[i] is greater than maxDiff then update maxDIff and store current index and add to sum if index+1 is not equal to current iteration index and finally return sum.He tried some test cases over my code and found that for some cases it was giving wrong answer,then he asked me that how is my command over dynamic programming,I told I know only the standard ones and no other experience,then he said this question is of DP but he was happy to see my approach.(About 20-25 min.) \n\n\n\n\nRound 3 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. She(interviewer) asked me if I attempted 3rd question in written test, I said I attempted only 1st and 2nd, then she gave me paper and told to implement the 3rd question. \nI suggested an approach to use two arrays of structures(for first characters and last characters) which will contain boolean value to mark presence of character in string and also its index. Now compare two arrays and see that if both arrays have same boolean value and different indices for all first and last characters. If so then strings can form a chain else not.She was in doubt for my solution so she found a testcase where my code was giving wrong answer,so she told me to look for another solution,I came up with another approach and told her that we can make a directed graph from first and last characters and then traverse it in DFS, now suppose if the visited node is visited again and count of total visited nodes is same as total nodes then we can say that strings will form a chain, now she was satisfied with approach and asked me to write code, now as my graph was weak i was in shock,so she said to just write the pseudocode. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth largest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nI suggested to declare a static variable count which will increment count if node visited in inorder and if count becomes k, I will print that node's data and return. Then she asked me how static works and difference between global and static. \n\n3. Given a mobile keypad of say nokia phone and a dictionary which has all the meaningful words which can be formed, suppose now user types some number(input) then your program must suggest all the meaningful words which are present in dictionary.Before implementing this she asked me the datastructure to store the dictionary efficiently and then how will you use this datastructure to make code. \nAt first, I suggested I will store dictionary in 2-D array and lexicograpphically sort it, now suppose user types a number the string starting with that character is searched in the array. she said to reduce complexity because dictionary may contain 1000s of words,then I suggested to use trie datastructure to store and search the string, she was satisfied now and asked me to explain the concept. \n4.Given preorder and postorder of a graph, how can you construct the graph. \nAs I heard this question, i was stuck for 2 minutes but then I said as far as graph is concerned I dont know about it but a unique tree cannot be constructed with preorder and postorder so as graph,so inorder is needed, she was happy and agreed on answer. \n\n\n\n\nRound 4 (Technical) (2:30 hr) \n1. Suppose a linked list is given and there is a loop, you have to find orphan nodes in O(n) time. orphan nodes are the nodes outside the loop. \n\n2. Design a BRTS traffic signalling system such that no two vehicle clashes. Note that BRTS bus will follow the BRTS traffic lights B1,B2,B3,B4 in 4 directions and regular traffic will follow regular traffic lights R1,R2,R3,R4 only. In input only maximum cycle time was given(time after which the process repeates) check for all corner cases (traffic lights have two states only (RED and GREEN)).you have to tell any one possible combination of traffic lights under maximum cycle time. (About 1hr discussion). \n\n3. Suppose a linked list is given but we dont know the count of nodes, you have to find the kth node from last without counting the nodes. \n4. Given an array of n integers such some elements are in the range 0 to n-1 and some out of range may be negative.You have to rearrange array such that all elements which are in range appear on their index and rest appear in sorted manner for indexes not present.This should be done in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nEg- suppose n=6 ,4 5 2 3 6 -3 output= -3,6,2,3,4,5 \n\n5. How can you implement stack using queue/queues. \n6. How can you sort the elements with the help of queue. \nI suggested one O(n) time solution along with O(n) extra space.He asked to do in O(1) space so I suggested deque, he seemed satisfied. \n\nonly 4 were selected till this round (I was one of them) \n\nRound 5 (Bar Raiser) (30 minutes) \n\n1. find the length of longest palindrome in a string starting from index 0. \n2. find if a string A is present in string B or not. \n3. find the length of longest prefix in a string \n\nAfter this 2 were selected finally and unfortunately I was not amongst them as they might have thought i was little stress out.

Round1: MCQ and coding round It was an online test of 60 minutes consisting of 20 aptitude question and 3 coding question. Platform used for the test was of makemytrip and slightly difficult to understand. Question1: Calculate the power of a ^ b mod c using logn approach.The thing that was to be taken care of was that you did not needed to return or print your answer but you had to store it in their predefined global variable. You could easily find the solution on geeksforgeeks site. Question2: Given a sentence you were supposed to calculate the count of Capital , small letter and number.Question seemed to be quite easy but the pick was that you needed to store the answer in char* output variable in the form of c1:c2:c3 where c1 represent count of capital letter c2 represent count of small letter and c3 represent count of number. (Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,""%d:%d:%d"",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities . Determine the maximum number of non conflicting activities that you can achieve. (Hint : make a structure of start and finish time and sort according to finishing interval) I solved 2 completely and 1 partially Tip:Since they have only one sample test case so even you are not able to solve the coding question just store the hard coded answer in that variable. I did that in last :P) Out of 110 students 30 students got selected for Personal Interview round. Round 2: Personal Interview Since I was last candidate in that list waiting from 10:30 am My turn came at 10:30 PM.The interviewer was very cool and friendly.He started with asking tell me about yourself and what projects I have done.After half hour rigerous discussion over my project and making schema of databases I used in project He started asking question on ds. Question1: Sort a linklist consisting of 0,1,2\'s. (Hint: I used hashmap of stl in c++ to store the count of 0,1 and 2) Question 2: Given a stock You need to find the maximum profit you can earn .You are allowed to buy and sell as many number of time you can.) Question 3:Design a treeset in java. (Hint:I told him to use BST but he told to think of more optimized way so Ii told AVL and wrote functions for insertion in AVL tree) Question4:Diffrentiate between method overloading and method overriding.What are static blocks in java. Question5: Drilling question on deployment descriptor,struts,mysql. Round3: Personal Interview The interviewer seemed to be exhausted . He asked me that Since you are the last person so all the question you would have asked. So tell me what all question you have asked. I told him distinct palindromic substring in string, LIS, LCS etc students told that you are asking.He thought for a while and told me to write standard bfs code for graph traversal. Question2: You have been given a matrix of character and a dictionary.You need to find the valid words that you can obtain from it and print it. (Hint:I used dfs to find the valid sequence and assumed that all words are stored in a hashmap) After these He asked 6 puzzles to be solved in a given time. Puzzle 1 : 1.5 hen give 1.5 egg in 1.5 day. How many hens are required to have 4 dozen of egg in 6 days. Puzzle 2: 2 ropes and take 1hr to burn. Calculate 45 min Puzzle 3:10 jar with 10gm marble in each jar.One jar contain 9gm marbles only.Find the defective jar in one turn. Puzzle4:150 person are standing in a queue in sorted order.A blind person comes and wants to be at right position in queue.So he asks any person whether he can stand in front of him.He will reply in Yes or No . You have to find the right place after 2Yes. Give a strategy to find the correct place. (Hint:This puzzle can be reduced to egg drop puzzle) Puzzle 5:25 horse having race find top 3 Puzzle 6:A person is riding a car and he sees a milestone A. After 1hr he sees milestone B which has digits reversed of A.After one hour more he finds a milestone C which contains all the digits of A and B . Given that A < B < C find the speed of car. (Other question that were asked from my friend 1.Distinct Palindrome in string 2.Transaction minimize problem 3.LCS and LIS (dp approach) 4.Diameter of tree 5.Pattern Matching Algorithm (KMP)) HR round: He asked me about my family background,what I do ,hobbies.What I know about makemytrip.What location I would prefer , whether I am satisfied with package or not,Working environment etc, It lasted for half hour.

On that day, I had 3 interviews of 1 hour long with some breaks in between. All the interviews happened online due to the pandemic situation.\n1st Round: Had some small chit-chat regarding how Work from Home is going on for him and me. Later he introduced himself and asked the same.\nComing to technical questions, he asked me the algorithm and also asked me to code both this and this. Discussed the time complexities and edge cases. \nThen he gave me the last 5 mins to ask any questions to him.\n2nd Round: This round started without any introduction, and he directly jumped into the question. Asked me about the algorithm, and later coded it and ran it. And then he asked me to optimize it. Finally, he asked me if I had any questions.\n3rd Round: This was the last round of the day. He introduced himself and asked how I reduced API response times(which I mentioned in my resume). We discussed it for 5-10 min. Then he asked about the project(can't share those details here) which I worked on in my prev company. Discussed use cases and complete design of the implementation. Then, he asked me a question which is similar to System Design. Finally, he asked me if I had any questions.\nAfter these 3 interviews, that night, HR called and informed me that I was selected for the 4th and final round. He scheduled a meeting for 4 days later.\nFinal Round: He started off by asking me to open my mobile phone and told me to open any messaging application and type something. Then, he pointed out to look at the suggestions after and while typing a word. Then, he asked me to design that functionality for a newly bought mobile. There are multiple ways to do it using Tries and Ternary Search Tree, we discussed some of them and one in-depth. Later, he asked me about Distributed File Systems and why and when they are used. And also about how the Single Point of Failure issue handled. By this time almost 50 min was completed. Then, he asked me to write the code for Sudoku solver. I explained the algorithm and gave a walkthrough, and he was convinced. But, when I ran it the test cases were not passing due to a very small bug. This round happened for around 1 and a half hours.\nAlmost a week later, I received a call from Microsoft telling me that I was selected. I was more than happy.

I was not able to answer almost all the answers correctly but gave almost 75% correct answers. The interviewer mainly focused on the problem-solving ability and the quality of conceptual knowledge. We were judged on 5 criteria in all the technical Interviews- DSA, Coding, Puzzles, Testing Questions and Operating system. 1: Basic Introductory Questions 2: 2-3 Puzzle Questions which we can easily find on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/ i: You have a birthday cake and have to cut it into 8 equal pieces by making 3 cuts only. How do you do it? ii: You are standing before two doors. One of the paths leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you don’t know who the honest one is and who the liar is.You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question? 3: Some basic Questions on DSA- about stacks, queue, arrays, memory storage accessing, Advantages and Dis of the Linked list over arrays, 4: Operating System: In all the rounds, Operating System questions were asked in abundance. Though the questions were basic, they focused more on our concepts like how easily we were able to explain it to them. Questions on Kernels, Types of Kernel, Why OS, memory allocation in OS were asked. 5: Test Cases Question: We have to think and answer the possible questions while testing the cases. i: Test cases for a login page window. 6: Heavy discussions on the projects I have done. Why we preferred to use a particular technology. What was my role in the project and so on. 7: I was asked to code some questions. i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1 ii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-second-largest-element2406/1 iii: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-loop-in-linked-list/1 After a wait of about 15 minutes, I was called for my second round of Interview.  \nFourth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 2\nThis round of interview was taken by a senior person of the company. It was a bit lengthy as we had more of a discussion rather than just a QnA round. The interview went for more than 90 minutes and was tougher than the first round. 1: There was a long discussion on what I have written in my resume. The projects I had done, Extracurricular and co-curricular activities I had written on the resume, the skills I have mentioned. All of it. So be careful of whatever you mention in the resume. 2: Next he asked me a bunch of coding questions which were some very popular ones i: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/anagram-1587115620/1 ii: Implementation of Merge Sort https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/ iii: Implementing Queue using stacks and Stack using queues. iv:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-repeated-character4108/1 I was asked to code in my preferred language. So there wasn’t any language barrier and for all the questions the interviewer asked for the most optimized approach. As I was able to answer all the questions, I wasn’t asked any more questions. 3: After the coding questions, I was asked a lot of questions about Operation System and OOPS. i:   Fragmentation- Internal and External ii:  Concepts of Kernel iii:  File Management iv:  Virtual functions and Friend Functions v:  Function Overloading And Overriding vi: What is paging and Demand Paging? 4: Interview puzzles: i: The mislabeled Jar puzzle https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-mislabeled-jars/ ii: Maximize probability of White Ball https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-12-maximize-probability-of-white-ball/ iii:  100 Prisoners with Red/Black Hats https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-13-100-prisoners-with-redblack-hats/ 5:  Testing Based Questions- i: Five new inventions in a glass frame and the test cases to test the working a frame. ii: Design test cases for a shopping application. The interviewer was quite satisfied with the test cases I answered. As the main trick to solve these kinds of interview questions is to design the test cases by giving every small function an eye and then forming all possible scenarios for the same.  \nFifth Round -TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 3 + MANAGERIAL ROUND\n  This was also similar to the last two Technical Interviews and was also easier from them. The interview went for about 70 minutes and It was tilted more towards the managerial side and less Technical was asked. 1: Program to Count set bits in an integer. (I answered 4 possible solutions to him and he was satisfied)  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-bits0143/1 2: Working of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort ( I was asked to dry run the solution mainly to check the internal working of swapping and comparison) 3: Torch and Bridge https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/ 4:  Some Mathematical Puzzles 5: Design test cases for OLA Application 6: Design test cases for GMAIL Application 7: Situation based questions 8: What is a Semaphore and operations on a semaphore? 9: What is context switching?  \nSixth Round - HR INTERVIEW\nIt was the last round and an eliminatory round as well.  The interviewer was pretty cool. After the introduction, I was asked questions like where are you from? What is special about you?  Why should we select you? Which was your favorite subject last semester? Which Adobe products you liked the most and why? It was a 20 minutes long discussion round about college life, interests, and hobbies. The HR also asked our preferred joining location between Noida and Bangalore which gave us many hopes of our selection. Three candidates from our college went to the HR Round. Two days later we received the confirmation mail that two students are selected.

Find all the rows which are having 1's at same position. Give all sets satisfying this. 2. In a stock market given are price of shares spread over a week. On what day should I buy and what day should i sell to get maximum profit. 3. Being a computer engineer why did I not opt for system side programming than web domain. (I had expr in web domain) 4. I had expr in web domain so he asked: What is the difference between web browser request and ajax call request. -- It is simple, by ajax call partial web page can be loaded. 5. Have you worked on ruby on rails? Round 2 : 1. Given a matrix containing numbers. Find the 0's and make all the rows and columns corresponding to that index as 0. 2. Design a structure for a File Uploader service (eg. Dropbox, google drive). It is a service where multiple people can upload data at the same time and it also lists the top five uploaders (who uploaded the maximum number of files). 3. Puzzle: There is an employer and a worker, the employer has a gold bar of 7 units and he has to give 1unit each on a day for 7 days. The employer has a magical knife which doesn't work once it performs two cuts(1 cut divides the bar into two parts) on the bar. How will you cut so that 1 unit on each day can be given to the worker. 4. Print left view of binary tree. Round 3 : 1. He discussed what things they work on Ola. How these things are implemented. Like he mentioned of bar code a product has and catalog kind of thing. 2. I had to explain what project I am working on currently, what is the team size. 3. a)Since I had worked on SQL and databases, so he asked me what data structure will I use to implement a database. --I gave hashmap as a soln (the key is our primary key and other fields we can store in an object which will be value for hashmap) b)Now, If in case you want to find all names starting with a particular word (eg. ram....).How will you do that? -- gave trie structure as soln. c)Now you need to find students whose marks are between a range i.e. between two numbers.

Tell me about yourself. Meanwhile he(interviewer) looked into my CV and asked about my projects. \nI have done 3 projects so he started discussion CUDA and parallel programming and how you implemented over images to detect edges and how much gain factor achieved. \nsecondly,I have made an project on online voting system so he asked me to draw E-R diagram, schemas and the relationship between them and their functionalities.About (25-30) minutes discussion. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth smallest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n\n3. Suppose you have server where multiple requests are coming at time to,t1,t2...Now suppose a user hits at any particular time t on the server then server should return the last request. you have to design the datastructure for the same. \nI suggested that we can use stack that will return the last request, he then asked me to do for last 10 requests then I suggested to use array of structures which will store request no. and timestamp along with them.Now at any time t we can move 10 elements back but he said that suppose user hits frequently then every time i will have to traverse back again and again so time complexity will be much high, I agreed and suggested another solution similar to LRU implementation so that the requests which are coming frequently can be processed faster. then he modified question that user wants requests of last 1 minute and he gave a hint that is it necessary to store all requests can we not just store requests of every 1 min only,then suddenly it clicked to me, I suggested to use deque for 60 secs now suppose request arrives at 61st sec then we can just add that at rear and remove one from front maintaining a window of 60 seconds.He was satisfied but he want that no deletion should be there so I told him to use circular deque so that we can replace previous elements.He was completely satisfied now with the approach.(About 35 min. discussion) \n\n4. Given an array containing prices of a share of 30 days.A person has 1 share which he can buy and sell any number of times, you have to find the maximum profit which can be earned. \nI suggested one approach to create two auxiliary array MIN from left and MAX from right and traverse both simultaneously if difference between MAX[i] and MIN[i] is greater than maxDiff then update maxDIff and store current index and add to sum if index+1 is not equal to current iteration index and finally return sum.He tried some test cases over my code and found that for some cases it was giving wrong answer,then he asked me that how is my command over dynamic programming,I told I know only the standard ones and no other experience,then he said this question is of DP but he was happy to see my approach.(About 20-25 min.) \n\n\n\n\nRound 3 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. She(interviewer) asked me if I attempted 3rd question in written test, I said I attempted only 1st and 2nd, then she gave me paper and told to implement the 3rd question. \nI suggested an approach to use two arrays of structures(for first characters and last characters) which will contain boolean value to mark presence of character in string and also its index. Now compare two arrays and see that if both arrays have same boolean value and different indices for all first and last characters. If so then strings can form a chain else not.She was in doubt for my solution so she found a testcase where my code was giving wrong answer,so she told me to look for another solution,I came up with another approach and told her that we can make a directed graph from first and last characters and then traverse it in DFS, now suppose if the visited node is visited again and count of total visited nodes is same as total nodes then we can say that strings will form a chain, now she was satisfied with approach and asked me to write code, now as my graph was weak i was in shock,so she said to just write the pseudocode. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth largest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nI suggested to declare a static variable count which will increment count if node visited in inorder and if count becomes k, I will print that node's data and return. Then she asked me how static works and difference between global and static. \n\n3. Given a mobile keypad of say nokia phone and a dictionary which has all the meaningful words which can be formed, suppose now user types some number(input) then your program must suggest all the meaningful words which are present in dictionary.Before implementing this she asked me the datastructure to store the dictionary efficiently and then how will you use this datastructure to make code. \nAt first, I suggested I will store dictionary in 2-D array and lexicograpphically sort it, now suppose user types a number the string starting with that character is searched in the array. she said to reduce complexity because dictionary may contain 1000s of words,then I suggested to use trie datastructure to store and search the string, she was satisfied now and asked me to explain the concept. \n4.Given preorder and postorder of a graph, how can you construct the graph. \nAs I heard this question, i was stuck for 2 minutes but then I said as far as graph is concerned I dont know about it but a unique tree cannot be constructed with preorder and postorder so as graph,so inorder is needed, she was happy and agreed on answer. \n\n\n\n\nRound 4 (Technical) (2:30 hr) \n1. Suppose a linked list is given and there is a loop, you have to find orphan nodes in O(n) time. orphan nodes are the nodes outside the loop. \n\n2. Design a BRTS traffic signalling system such that no two vehicle clashes. Note that BRTS bus will follow the BRTS traffic lights B1,B2,B3,B4 in 4 directions and regular traffic will follow regular traffic lights R1,R2,R3,R4 only. In input only maximum cycle time was given(time after which the process repeates) check for all corner cases (traffic lights have two states only (RED and GREEN)).you have to tell any one possible combination of traffic lights under maximum cycle time. (About 1hr discussion). \n\n3. Suppose a linked list is given but we dont know the count of nodes, you have to find the kth node from last without counting the nodes. \n4. Given an array of n integers such some elements are in the range 0 to n-1 and some out of range may be negative.You have to rearrange array such that all elements which are in range appear on their index and rest appear in sorted manner for indexes not present.This should be done in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nEg- suppose n=6 ,4 5 2 3 6 -3 output= -3,6,2,3,4,5 \n\n5. How can you implement stack using queue/queues. \n6.

Round1: MCQ and coding round It was an online test of 60 minutes consisting of 20 aptitude question and 3 coding question. Platform used for the test was of makemytrip and slightly difficult to understand. Question1: Calculate the power of a ^ b mod c using logn approach.The thing that was to be taken care of was that you did not needed to return or print your answer but you had to store it in their predefined global variable. You could easily find the solution on geeksforgeeks site. Question2: Given a sentence you were supposed to calculate the count of Capital , small letter and number.Question seemed to be quite easy but the pick was that you needed to store the answer in char* output variable in the form of c1:c2:c3 where c1 represent count of capital letter c2 represent count of small letter and c3 represent count of number. (Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,""%d:%d:%d"",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities . Determine the maximum number of non conflicting activities that you can achieve. (Hint : make a structure of start and finish time and sort according to finishing interval) I solved 2 completely and 1 partially Tip:Since they have only one sample test case so even you are not able to solve the coding question just store the hard coded answer in that variable. I did that in last :P) Out of 110 students 30 students got selected for Personal Interview round. Round 2: Personal Interview Since I was last candidate in that list waiting from 10:30 am My turn came at 10:30 PM.The interviewer was very cool and friendly.He started with asking tell me about yourself and what projects I have done.After half hour rigerous discussion over my project and making schema of databases I used in project He started asking question on ds. Question1: Sort a linklist consisting of 0,1,2\'s. (Hint: I used hashmap of stl in c++ to store the count of 0,1 and 2) Question 2: Given a stock You need to find the maximum profit you can earn .You are allowed to buy and sell as many number of time you can.) Question 3:Design a treeset in java. (Hint:I told him to use BST but he told to think of more optimized way so Ii told AVL and wrote functions for insertion in AVL tree) Question4:Diffrentiate between method overloading and method overriding.What are static blocks in java. Question5: Drilling question on deployment descriptor,struts,mysql. Round3: Personal Interview The interviewer seemed to be exhausted . He asked me that Since you are the last person so all the question you would have asked. So tell me what all question you have asked. I told him distinct palindromic substring in string, LIS, LCS etc students told that you are asking.He thought for a while and told me to write standard bfs code for graph traversal. Question2: You have been given a matrix of character and a dictionary.You need to find the valid words that you can obtain from it and print it. (Hint:I used dfs to find the valid sequence and assumed that all words are stored in a hashmap) After these He asked 6 puzzles to be solved in a given time. Puzzle 1 : 1.5 hen give 1.5 egg in 1.5 day. How many hens are required to have 4 dozen of egg in 6 days. Puzzle 2: 2 ropes and take 1hr to burn. Calculate 45 min Puzzle 3:10 jar with 10gm marble in each jar.One jar contain 9gm marbles only.Find the defective jar in one turn. Puzzle4:150 person are standing in a queue in sorted order.A blind person comes and wants to be at right position in queue.So he asks any person whether he can stand in front of him.He will reply in Yes or No . You have to find the right place after 2Yes. Give a strategy to find the correct place. (Hint:This puzzle can be reduced to egg drop puzzle) Puzzle 5:25 horse having race find top 3 Puzzle 6:A person is riding a car and he sees a milestone A. After 1hr he sees milestone B which has digits reversed of A.After one hour more he finds a milestone C which contains all the digits of A and B . Given that A < B < C find the speed of car. (Other question that were asked from my friend 1.Distinct Palindrome in string 2.Transaction minimize problem 3.LCS and LIS (dp approach) 4.Diameter of tree 5.Pattern Matching Algorithm (KMP)) HR round: He asked me about my family background,what I do ,hobbies.What I know about makemytrip.What location I would prefer , whether I am satisfied with package or not,Working environment etc, It lasted for half hour.

Note: We can only sell a stock which we have bought earlier and we cannot hold multiple stocks on any day.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output: 865
Explanation: Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 => 310 – 100 = 210 Buy the stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6 => 695 – 40 = 655 Maximum Profit = 210 + 655 = 865
Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 2, 2, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy the stock on day 3 and sell it on day 4 => 4 – 2 = 2
Input: arr[] = [4, 2]
Output: 0
Explanation: Don't Buy the stock.
