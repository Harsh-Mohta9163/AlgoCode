      "problem": "You are given n identical eggs and you have access to a k-floored building from 1 to k.\nThere exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= k such that any egg dropped from a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped from or below floor f will not break.\nThere are few rules given below.\nAn egg that survives a fall can be used again.\nA broken egg must be discarded.\nThe effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.\nIf the egg doesn't break at a certain floor, it will not break at any floor below.\nIf the egg breaks on a certain floor, it will break on any floor above.\nReturn the minimum number of moves you need to determine the value of f with certainty.\nExamples:\nInput: n = 2, k = 36\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: In all the situations, 8 maximum moves are required to find the maximum floor. Following is the strategy to do so:\nDrop from floor 8 → If breaks, check 1-7 sequentially.\nDrop from floor 15 → If breaks, check 9-14.\nDrop from floor 21 → If breaks, check 16-20.\nDrop from floor 26 → If breaks, check 22-25.\nDrop from floor 30 → If breaks, check 27-29.\nDrop from floor 33 → If breaks, check 31-32.\nDrop from floor 35 → If breaks, check 34.\nDrop from floor 36 → Final check.\nInput: n = 1, k = 36\nOutput: 36\nExplanation: Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 36 droppings.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ n ≤ 1000\n1 ≤ k ≤ 1000"
