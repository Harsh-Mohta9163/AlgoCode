"[{'title': 'Atlassian Interview Experience', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/atlassian-interview-experience/', 'content_summary': ""I am sharing my experience of interviewing with Atlassian. The whole process is divided into the following sections:\nOnline Test:\nThe online test was conducted on Hackerrank. The time duration was 90 mins and there were 3 problems.\nProblem 1:\nThis was a simple problem(50 pts) but R was the only allowed programming language. That's the reason none of us was able to solve it.\nProblem 2:\nIt was a simple DP on Tree based problem(75 pts).\nGiven a tree (general graph) of n nodes with values of each node being the node number (ie: node x has value x). In each query, we will be given a node and a value of jump. So, we need to calculate the total value when we start at the given node and jump by jump amount towards the root of the tree. So, if the jump value is 3, we move from initial node to its 3rd ancestor, then 6th ancestor, 9th, and so on until u cannot jump further.\nThere were q queries(q <= 10^5) but the key point was the jump value for each query was <=10. In other words, in each jump, u cannot move beyond its 10th ancestor.\nProblem 3:\nThis was a standard problem(100 pts).\nYou are given an array where each element (arr[i]) represents the height of the tower at position i.\nFor each i, we need to calculate the nearest index j (j > i or j < i) whose height is less than current tower's height (arr[j] < arr[i]). If there exist two such towers - one to the right and one to the left - choose the one which is closest to it.\nIt can be easily solved using two stacks (one for right & other for left).\nTechnical Round 1:\nThere were two interviewers and both were really cool and amazing. I felt really comfortable coding with them.\nIt was conducted on Zoom. I used my atom editor and shared screen.\nSo the question goes as:\nWe have to decide the winner amongst the candidates in a voting process. Basically, u have been given a list of strings. Each string represents the name of a candidate. The no of times the string appears in the list gives the no of votes he has got.\nSo far very simple. Use a map (ordered or unordered) and count their occurrences. The string(name) having the highest occurrence is the winner.\nBut how do we handle if there is a tie? A tie happens when multiple candidates get the same amount of votes.\nWe discussed multiple strategies for that. One important strategy was to take the weighted value (so C1(2,2,2,1) will win over C2(2,2,1,1,1)).\nI was using multiple data structures like map, unordered_map etc. The interviewer asked me to arrange these data structures because they looked very complicated.\nThen I created a struct of each Candidate. I put candidate_name, winner (bool), vector<int> votes, totol_votes as its attributes. Finally, I created a vector<Candidate> which greatly simplified the implementation.\nThe actual thing they wanted to test was how I approach the problems. How I debug them (Very important). How to handle corner cases? How to keep things simple? All the while, expressing what u are really trying to do rather than being quiet and coding.\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/winner-of-an-election-where-votes-are-represented-as-candidate-names-1587115621/1\nTechnical Round 2:\nThis round consisted of a single interviewer and was conducted on Zoom.\nIt was a code pair round on Hackerrank. It was the longest of all and was very exhaustive.\nIt can also be subdivided into multiple phases:\nPhase 1:\nDiscussion on projects. I mentioned multiple projects involving REST APIs, AWS services(AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS CloudWatch, etc.). GraphQL, golang, MongoDB, NodeJS etc.\nIt took more than 0.5 hrs. The focus was on:\nWhat does it mean? Why u chose this over others?\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages? What are the technical challenges u faced?\nEx: Why REST APIs? Why GraphQL when there is REST? Why go? Why AWS Lambda and not some other AWS service? etc\nPhase 2:\nIt was a problem-solving round.\nThe interviewer was not being very clear about the requirements of the problem so it took really some time to understand the problem. So, I suggest u to understand the problem by repeatedly asking clarifying questions.\nYou are given an initial string. The problem is to find the longest matching prefix for each string in a long list of strings.\nI told him about KMP algorithm and discussed different other algorithms as well. But, he was keen on knowing what DATA STRUCTURE I would use.\nFinally, I got it. We need to use a TRIE to get prefix for each string. Actually, I asked for a hint and he said that don't worry about memory, Assume we have lots of memory at our disposal. Trie immediately clicked in my mind.\nHe seemed very happy at my answer. He didn't tell me to implement Trie. (But one should be always ready for that).\nPhase 3:\nAfter the first 2 phases, he asked me about my favorite subjects.\nI answered: Algorithms, Data structures, and Operating Systems. He told me that we have already tested your algo & ds skills. Let's move to Operating systems.\nThe key point was : I am highly interested in OS and have read Silberschatz from front to back. I guess that's the reason I didn't face much difficulty in this phase.\nQuestions:\nWhich OS does u use as a CS engineer?\nLinux. Ubuntu.\nWhy Linux? Tell me about Linux.\nLinux is open-source OS. It is based on Monolithic kernel architecture and uses CFS scheduling algorithm which employs RB trees.\nMultiple follow-up questions on:\nMonolithic VS Microkernel\nExample of microkernel\nWindows vs Linux\nDifferences between Process and Thread?\nKernel space vs Userspace?\nVirtual memory?\nSwapping? How does the virtual memory map to physical memory?\nHow do processes communicate? Shared memory & message passing?\nDevice drivers?\nThe interview was scheduled for 1 hr but it went for 1hr 20 mins or more. But, it was very interesting and I loved discussing concepts with the interviewer.\nHR Round:\nThe final round was an HR round.\nI must admit that he was the coolest guy I have ever met with. He introduced himself and asked me to introduce it as well.\nHis communication skill was amazing and we had a really good 2-way conversation going along.\nQuestions:\nSummarize your Engineering journey.\nWhat is the thing you would like to change about your college?\nWhat is the biggest failure in your life? How did u overcome that? Do u regret it?\nHow do your personal values align with that of Atlassian?\nWhat role does u love to play in a team?\nQuestions I asked the interviewer:\nHow Atlassian differs from other companies?\nThe points he talked we really helpful and exciting.\nWhat are the opportunities I would have at Atlassian?\nThere are a hell lot of opportunities.\nIt was an amazing experience. The interviewer was very calm and understanding.\nThis concludes my experience with Atlassian. Hope this article helps to get an understanding of the interview process at Atlassian.\nAll the best!!\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAtlassian Interview Experience""}]",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/winner-of-an-election-where-votes-are-represented-as-candidate-names-1587115621--162858/1?page=1&company=Adobe&sortBy=latest,2025-06-11T12:04:12.241548,GeeksforGeeks,Winner of an election,Easy,80.95%,168+,Not available,"Given a lowercase string array arr[].

A swap is defined as selecting two indices i and j in the array and exchanging the elements at these indices, i.e., performing a swap(arr[i], arr[j]). The goal is to move all 1s into a contiguous subarray with the least number of swaps.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

The process started with pre-placement talks and then we had to undergo a 5-round process. Round 1: Online (30 min) The first round was conducted online,which consisted of MCQ\'s covering C, C++, OS, DBMS. We had to answer 20 questions, and yes there was a negative marking (-0.25) for each wrong answer. Around 650 people took the online test and 75 people were selected for the next round. Round 2: Paper Coding (1 hr) We were asked to code the following questions on paper: 1. Print shortest path to print a string on screen 2. Find zeroes to be flipped so that number of consecutive 1’s is maximized 3. Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree Out of the 75 people who took this test 20 were shortlisted. We then had 3 technical interviews on the next day. Round 3: F2F interview (2 hrs) I was the first person to be shortlisted and so I was interviewed by the Senior Technical Director of the company. She asked me about my favorite data structure to which I replied Trees. So she asked me to do a zig-zag level order traversal of a binary tree.\n Level order traversal in spiral form\nShe then gave a string in the encoded form and asked me to find the k\'th character in the string without decoding it. For example: Input: Encoded string is ""a9b21c5"" and k=27 Output: \'b\'\nShe then gave me a real-time problem which she faced last week and asked me to provide a solution and code it. Scenario: There is an API which receives data from a socket which is fetched using a buffer. There was no guarantee of how much data is read through the socket (i.e. the first time 5 characters may be read, the second time 20 characters may be read). The data to be read consisted of an HTTP header and a message to be displayed. The header was separated from the header by means of a delimiter(here it was ""000|"" ). I had to write a code which discards the HTTP header and displays the message alone considering the fact that there was no way of finding out how many characters were read by the socket. She concluded by asking about my projects.\nRound 4: F2F interview(1.30 hrs) The interview asked me to code the following questions:\n Trapping Rain Water\n Given a linked list and an integer \'k\', I had to rotate the linked list.(Note: Reversing a linked list is different) Input : 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10 and k=4 Output: 4->1->2->3-> 8->5->6->7->9->10\n He gave me a string represented by a binary tree(each leaf node is a character) and a random function that might swap any number of internal nodes of the binary tree(just like mirror). I had to find out if the string (represented by the tree)returned after the randomized function call is a valid permutation of the original string. Eg: Input: ""golden"" and ""gloned"" where gloned is the string returned after calling randomized function. Output: True Input: ""golden"" and ""gnlode"" Output: False\nRound 5: F2F interview(1.30 hrs) The interviewer gave me two scenarios and asked me to write an algorithm for both. Scenario 1: I had to reach Paris from Chennai by flight. He wanted me to find the best possible way to reach Paris. I told him that I would use Djikstra\'s algorithm based on distance, one solution based on time and one solution based on both distance and time(using weighted averages). He then asked me to minimize the number of points to be considered at each intermediate vertex. I told him to use the latitude and longitude to find the direction of the destination and consider points accordingly. He then asked me to draw a line between the source and destination and asked me to consider only points which were inside an inclination of 30 degrees of the line drawn. I gave him a solution and he was satisfied. Scenario 2: He asked me to assume there were 100 airports in my city and he asked me to suggest an algorithm for choosing the airport given the destination and the timings of each flight at each airport. He then asked me to incorporate the significance of ""traffic"" while I travel from my current location to the airport and asked me to design accordingly. He asked me if I had any questions for him, to which I posed a lot of questions regarding the company\'s structure, clients and any pre-requisites to be learnt before I could join the company.

Firstly, they presented a pre-placement-talk where they talked about their work culture, their biggest clients, their intra, fests, etc. The work life aspect was discussed too. \n\nFollowing this, they conducted Online test for 30 min that included MCQ questions from \nC, C++ : finding o/p, complexity, bugs if any \nDBMS: Join queries, indexing and theory \nOS and Networks: Basic theory Networking \nand Little Quantitative Aptitude. \nAround 200 Students appeared for this round. 11 were shortlisted for first round interviews. I got through this round. For the next top 10, a coding round of pen/paper (1 hour) was carried out from where only 2 were shortlisted. There were three questions as narrated by my friends. One on tries, one on heap, one on sorting. Thus, 13 people made it for technical interviews. \n\nRound 1 FFS : 1 hour \nThe two interviewers congratulated me for reaching this far. \n\n1) After a little introduction, they threw me a puzzle. 3 _ 1 _ 3 _ 6 = 8. I had to fill the spaces with any operator I can, to satisfy the equality. I thought for about 5 mins. Then I gave the following: (3 ^ 1) & 3 + 6. They were happy with the not so conventional approach but directed me towards a simpler construction. See if you can find it yourself \n\n2) Then followed a barrage of sql queries, probably as I had mentioned databases in my resume. I suggest everyone to practice join queries. \n\n3) Next question was to detect the merging point of two linked lists with length m and n. I initially gave the hashmap solution which he asked me to code. Then he asked for other less expensive ways. I reduced problem into finding the start node of a loop, if modification was allowed, otherwise, advancing the longer by the difference between the two lengths. Full working code was required along with the time and space complexities. \n\n4) Another question was to find a triplet in the array that sums to a particular value. \nAfter this, I was notified to get ready for round 2. Five folks were eliminated. \n\nRound 2 FFS: 2 hours \n1) Given a huge array consisting of integers in a certain range. How would you solve the queries of the following type : Report the number of integers lying in the range between l to r. I built a prefix array as in the counting sort. Now all queries could be answered in O(1). He modified the question by stating that the range now was always a multiple of some number. I proceeded by dividing the i/p into buckets and then building the prefix array. Full code was asked. \n\n2) Given a huge numbers of strings in an arraylist, report the longest common prefix of the strings. I solved this by creating a trie with an augmented node storing depth and count at each node. Only the important modules were asked to be coded. \n\n3) Short discussion of my summer internship, why I used JAVA, what challenges did I face. He asked me to explain the differences between treeMap, linkedHashMap and hashMap. \n\n4) I had mentioned a project carried out on Linux Mint. He asked me the basic commands of linux, namely cat, grep, ps, df along with syntax for git commands. \n\n5) Assume a traveller wants to books a cab. Write an automated server that schedules a cab present in the region pool of the user in a way that maximizes the benefit to the company. You can make assumptions like GPS availability. At first, I had no clue where I was heading. Then I broke down the problem into structures and assumed the necessary. This was more of a discussion sort of thing, as this had no definitive answer. I had to write the pseudocode of anything I thought. 30 mins went straight into this question. \n\n6) Core JAVA Questions. 7-8 of them including but not limited to new operator, constructor, static blocks, synchronized keywords etc. \n3 were eliminated. I got through to round 3. \n\nRound 3: FFS 1:15 hours \nThe interviewer greeted and informed me of this round being a techno-managerial round. \n1) You are the manager of a restaurant. Given the archives of past purchases of raw materials per day of the week, write an algorithm that forecasts the amount of each raw material to be purchased so as to cover the next week requirements. Mention data structures used, if any. After thinking for a while, I proceeded by the method of weighted averages, assigned more weight to weekends over weekdays, special diets etc. I said, I being the manager would use the trend adjustment factor to forecast the next demand (economics helped Explained this using an example. \n\n2) Given an i/p stream of train coaches in the following format: XY where X: uppercase letter, Y: a number, what is the most efficient way to sort the coaches such that at the end of the stream, we can get the sorted order in O(1). eg. A3, B2, C10, A1 -> o/p A1, A3, B2, C10. \nAlso prove why comparison sorts have a lower bound of O(nlogn) where n is the size of the input. \n\n3) How do you delete an arbitrary item from a heap. Write the code. Even the redundant lines in my code were subjected to scrutiny. \nI wasn't confident of my performance in this round, but stayed positive. It had been 10 hours of waiting. \n\nHR Round(15 mins) \nThe HR Ma'am was very friendly. Asked me what I knew about the company so far. I had a feeling I was being tested for my listening skills against the morning pre-placement presentation. \n\nI would like to thanks geeksforgeeks for their content that helped me through. A word of advice: Practice pen and paper codes. Never lie on your resume, it may back-fire at any moment.

(at Noida) \nDS Questions:- First question was to write a code of finding an intersection point in the merged linked lists, first I gave the stack based approach then optimized with the hashtable based approach. \nNext question was to find the pairs of numbers which make a given sum in the given array , only the approach was asked, so initially I gave loop based approach then optimized it with a hashing. Just then he asked me to find triplets which could make a sum as zero. \nThen third question was to find the minimum length section of an array which could be sorted to make the whole array as sorted , this was a little bit tricky, but the interviewer was helpful in giving couple of hints. \n\nCS Fundamentals:- \nI mentioned in my introduction that I am proficient in Java so he asked me some basic questions like difference between abstract class and interface and questions like what is inheritance how it is useful . There were also some questions on OS. \n\nTechnical Round 2:- \nHe asked me the working of google maps, what is the algorithm behind that and how would I implement it and if I need to find out the nearby clinics then what is the best way to do that. Then he asked me difference between BFS and DFS which one is better for the above functionality. Then he asked me a random question that GPS would work without internet or not. Then I was asked to code random number generating function which does not generates a pregenerated number twice. Then a couple of questions related to my projects. \nThen he asked OS questions, like what is Thrashing and how to prevent it, if you are rich then would you buy a 500 gb ram, if no why?( my ans-No, as Searching in ram then will become a costly operation) then there were questions on Paging, TLB, Virtual memory, Logical address etc. \n\nTechnical Round 3:- \nFirst he asked me about my projects(in detail this time), then he gave me a system design problem, to design a lift management system with multiple lifts and write the classes required tothe same, his main focus was on to find an algorithm to allocate lift so as to minimize the waiting time spent by a person.Firstly he asked me to find all the edge cases like if 2 lifts are equally far \nfrom a requesting floors then how will you allocate, so after a heavy discussion he asked me to write the code. \nThen some non-technical questions were asked like what would you change in your past in your education and why. \n\nHR Round:- \nIt was just a 10 min round.He asked general questions about the college placements then if I already had any offer and its details.Then I asked him that whether freshers are hired for purely research work in Adobe and if not then what is the procedure to get there. \n\nTips:- \nMake sure you brush up your CS fundamentals(especially OS and the language in which you are proficient ). They watch you throughout the day, even if you are sitting outside the interview hall, so be aware of that. It is ok not to answer all the questions correctly, you might go wrong with some but don’t let that demoralize or demotivate you as you need to be energetic till the end. \n\nAll the best!!\n \nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAdobe Interview Experience (5 Rounds)'}]",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/intersection-point-in-y-shaped-linked-lists--170645/1?page=1&company=Adobe&sortBy=latest,2025-06-11T12:08:00.322579,GeeksforGeeks,Intersection Point in Y Shaped Linked Lists,Medium,55.77%,29K+,Not available,"Given two singly linked lists, write a program to get the point where two linked lists intersect each other.

There was no negative marking. Paper Coding round 21 students were shortlisted from the 1st MCQ round and in this round we were asked to write the codes (function only) of 3 questions in 1 hour time. Q1. You are given a matrix of size MxN and only possible values in the matrix are 0 - representing empty position 1 – representing a fresh apple 2 – representing a rotten apple A rotten apple converts all the fresh apples to rotten ones which are adjacent to it in 1 unit of time. Given an input the matrix and you have to calculate the amount of time in which all the fresh apples become rotten. Also determine whether all fresh apples could be made rotten in finite time or not. (20 marks) Input 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 0 2 1 After 1 time unit, the matrix will be transformed to 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 1 0 0 2 2 After 2 time units the matrix will look like 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 Hence output should be 2 time units. (Definition of adjacent only included the left , right, bottom and upper cell and NOT diagonal cell) Q2. You are given a Binary tree and you need to find out the maximum path sum between any 2 leaf nodes of the binary tree (The maximum path sum may or may not pass through root of tree). To be done in O(n) time (20 marks) Q3. You are given an unsorted array of integers and you need to find out whether there exists a majority element in it. (Majority element is one which appears more than n/2 times in an array of size n). To be done in O(n) time (10 Marks) The result of this round was declared late in the night. Some 7 or 8 students were called for the face to face interview rounds. I was the first one to be called and F2F rounds started at 11.30 PM and ended up in 5 AM in the morning :-p I was lucky to be free around 1.15 AM Face 2 Face Round 1 Q1. I couldn’t complete my Paper coding round question 1 (rotten apples). She (the interviewer) asked me to rectify the problem in it. I did it with the help of MxN extra space for visited[][] matrix. She said do it inplace. I did by modifying the Matrix values to 3 , 4 , etc. Q2. Find 5th from last element in a singly linked list. Firstly I gave a solution which took two traversals. She said to do it in 1 traversal only. I did it by taking two pointers and maintaining a distance of 5 nodes between them. Q3. You are given a string for example if input string is “I am abc xyz”. Output should be the modified string as “xyz abc am I” .This was to be done inplace and in O(n) time. Q4. You are given a unsorted array of both positive and negative integers. You need to find out the maximum sum subarray in O(n) time. You need to find the start and ending indexes along with the sum. Q5. You are given a BST and two keys k1 and k2. You need to find out the lowest common ancestor of the two keys Iteratively. I suggested the solution of storing the path in a vector and finding the 1st mismatch of key value in the root to k1 and root t k2 path. Face to Face round 2 Q1. Take the example of paper coding round rotten apples question and suggest some algorithm where you are allowed to change the position of rotten and fresh apples in such a way that the resultant matrix converts least number of fresh apples to rotten apples. I suggested an approach where I would first count the number of rotten and fresh apples initially and arrange all fresh apples in a sub-matrix starting from (0, 0) position and similarly arrange all rotten apples in sub-matrix from (N-1, M-1) position. He was satisfied with this approach Q2. You are given an elevator system with 3 elevators, you have to suggest some algorithm in which the amount of time that a person waiting on some x floor and has pressed the up or down button should wait for least amount of time and also the person inside the elevator also should not wait for too long to reach his destination floor. Q3. Asked some general questions as to what are tokens of a language. What is a grammar and production rules. Then he asked me to check whether a given code in some language is syntactically correct or not. You are provided the set of valid tokens for this language and also symbol table. Q4. You are given a text file storing characters or words. Suggest some way to compress the file such that there is always some amount of space compression possible. I suggested to use a trie tree as all the prefixes will share the space. He said this approach is dependent on whether the input has common prefixes or not. Suggest some other way. I then said that we can use Huffman Encoding and assign smallest code to most frequent word in the file and so on. He said again this approach also is dependent on whether your input has frequently occurring words or not. Then I suggested that since all characters can be represented in terms of 8 bits or 1 byte. We can take the XOR of prev and next character and store it in the current character position. This way I would be able to always get a n/2 size reduction in the encoded file. The idea was similar to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-linked-list-a-memory-efficient-doubly-linked-list-set-1/ He was satisfied and this was the end of my 2nd F2F round. He told me to get some sleep because you will be having a skype interview with our technical manager followed by HR round in the morning. 3rd round (Skype) Q1. He asked me to define NP and NP hard problems followed by the definition of automata and regular language. He then asked me are regular expressions. Q2. He shared a google doc with me and gave me a regular expression like abab*(a|b) and an input string s. I needed to write a code to check whether the given input string could be generated from this regular expression or not. Return a Boolean true or false value. I coded it up in 5 minutes :-p Q3. You are given a N-ary tree and a value K. You need to return true if there exists some root to leaf path having sum = k and false otherwise. I did it using recursion and in O(n) time. He told me that you’ll be having your final HR round in some time. I knew that I was going well because he seemed to be quite satisfied with my answers. Final HR round That was the round for which I’ve been waiting for hours She (the HR) started off with some general questions like tell me about yourself and your aims and goals in life. What are your hobbies. I told her that I love art and craft. She asked me what will I make for her if tomorrow is her birthday :-p She was very friendly and nice to talk to. It didn’t seem that I was talking to the HR. It was more like talking to a friend. She asked me what I liked about Accolite and why do I wish to join the company and stuff. Finally we discussed about the pay-scale and work culture in Accolite.\nRelated Practice Problems\nXOR Linked List\nMaximum path sum\nMajority Element\nn'th node from end of linked list\nLowest Common Ancestor in a BST\nReverse words in a given string\nKadane's Algorithm\nRotten Oranges\nAll Practice Problems for Accolite !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nAccolite Interview Experience | Set 3 (On-Campus)""}, {'title': 'Adobe Interview Experience For Mts 1 2', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adobe-interview-experience-for-mts-1-2/', 'content_summary': 'First, there was an online round on cocubes of 1 hr 30 min. 1hr was for aptitude which consisted of 60 questions(mental ability, comprehensive, reasoning) and next 30 min was for 2 coding questions that were very basic. Accuracy required in aptitude as coding questions were done by all and aptitude made all the difference. Candidates shortlisted were called for interview in their office. Round 1: \nFirst, he asked me to brief about yourself and there was a long discussion about my projects and their applications. As I mentioned the github link for all the projects, he visited my profile and checked my repositories and asked about github and the tools I have used.\nDetect the loop in the linked list and then find the point from where the loop started. he then asked to write the code. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1\nSearch in row-wise and column wise sorted matrix. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix17201720/1  he emptied some cells in the matrix and asked how to insert the number in the matrix. only logic was required.\nWhat are threads and processes? Can two threads in a process communicate? Is communication possible between two threads of two different processes? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-thread-communication-java/   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication/\nRound 2:\nFirst the small introduction and then he asked to rate my favorite(java) programming language.\nAgain the same question of the linked list was asked in the 2nd round but this time he asked me to prove my solution. Proof of solution of slow and fast pointer concept to find the meeting point was asked. He wants me to answer that the point where slow and fast pointer meets is the midpoint of the whole linked list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1\nFind the nth node from the end of a linked list and write the code. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nth-node-from-end-of-linked-list/1\nPostorder traversal of a tree and code it.\nDifference between mutex and semaphore. Difference between the mutex and binary semaphore.\nAt last, a long discussion of about 45min on the implementation of hashmap was held. He made a class where hashcode method and equals method of object class was overridden. the object of the class was the key and many values were put in the hashmap and the output was asked along with the size of an array used in a hashmap and then their time complexity. He changed the implementation of the above 2 methods 4 times and then asked the same questions. For Ex, if hashcode return 1 and equals method return true always then every time value is overwritten and size of an array is 1 and complexity is O(1) as the complexity of hashcode and equals method is O(1).\nThen again discussion continued on hashmap. Given a class of city which contains all the malls in it and a class of mall which contains cities in which it is present. what should be done to make both city and mall to act as a key of the hashmap. Here runtime polymorphism was used where a base class was made with equals and hashcode method which is inherited by both city and mall class. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internal-working-of-hashmap-java/\nRound 3:\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-by-90-degree-1587115621/1\nif you have a directory of many files then how will you find the duplicate files or which data structure is best for performing that search of duplicate files. Ans: hashmap. this technique is used by WhatsApp to remove all the duplicate messages like forwarded messages.\nHe scanned my resume and asked me to detail about my all the projects and many questions were asked related to it. All the technical problems faced etc.\nAs I was the vice-captain of volleyball so he asked about the duties of a captain. Is it possible to have a captain and a vice-captain not in playing six?\nRound 4 (HR): General discussion. The evaluation was not done in this round. Asked me about good and bad of adobe. He explained everything about Adobe its culture its spread its new technologies. My Feedback from previous interviewers was discussed. Finally, I got the offer.

"[{'title': 'Atlassian Interview Experience', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/atlassian-interview-experience/', 'content_summary': ""I am sharing my experience of interviewing with Atlassian. The whole process is divided into the following sections:\nOnline Test:\nThe online test was conducted on Hackerrank. The time duration was 90 mins and there were 3 problems.\nProblem 1:\nThis was a simple problem(50 pts) but R was the only allowed programming language. That's the reason none of us was able to solve it.\nProblem 2:\nIt was a simple DP on Tree based problem(75 pts).\nGiven a tree (general graph) of n nodes with values of each node being the node number (ie: node x has value x). In each query, we will be given a node and a value of jump. So, we need to calculate the total value when we start at the given node and jump by jump amount towards the root of the tree. So, if the jump value is 3, we move from initial node to its 3rd ancestor, then 6th ancestor, 9th, and so on until u cannot jump further.\nThere were q queries(q <= 10^5) but the key point was the jump value for each query was <=10. In other words, in each jump, u cannot move beyond its 10th ancestor.\nProblem 3:\nThis was a standard problem(100 pts).\nYou are given an array where each element (arr[i]) represents the height of the tower at position i.\nFor each i, we need to calculate the nearest index j (j > i or j < i) whose height is less than current tower's height (arr[j] < arr[i]). If there exist two such towers - one to the right and one to the left - choose the one which is closest to it.\nIt can be easily solved using two stacks (one for right & other for left).\nTechnical Round 1:\nThere were two interviewers and both were really cool and amazing. I felt really comfortable coding with them.\nIt was conducted on Zoom. I used my atom editor and shared screen.\nSo the question goes as:\nWe have to decide the winner amongst the candidates in a voting process. Basically, u have been given a list of strings. Each string represents the name of a candidate. The no of times the string appears in the list gives the no of votes he has got.\nSo far very simple. Use a map (ordered or unordered) and count their occurrences. The string(name) having the highest occurrence is the winner.\nBut how do we handle if there is a tie? A tie happens when multiple candidates get the same amount of votes.\nWe discussed multiple strategies for that. One important strategy was to take the weighted value (so C1(2,2,2,1) will win over C2(2,2,1,1,1)).\nI was using multiple data structures like map, unordered_map etc. The interviewer asked me to arrange these data structures because they looked very complicated.\nThen I created a struct of each Candidate. I put candidate_name, winner (bool), vector<int> votes, totol_votes as its attributes. Finally, I created a vector<Candidate> which greatly simplified the implementation.\nThe actual thing they wanted to test was how I approach the problems. How I debug them (Very important). How to handle corner cases? How to keep things simple? All the while, expressing what u are really trying to do rather than being quiet and coding.\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/winner-of-an-election-where-votes-are-represented-as-candidate-names-1587115621/1\nTechnical Round 2:\nThis round consisted of a single interviewer and was conducted on Zoom.\nIt was a code pair round on Hackerrank. It was the longest of all and was very exhaustive.\nIt can also be subdivided into multiple phases:\nPhase 1:\nDiscussion on projects. I mentioned multiple projects involving REST APIs, AWS services(AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS CloudWatch, etc.). GraphQL, golang, MongoDB, NodeJS etc.\nIt took more than 0.5 hrs. The focus was on:\nWhat does it mean? Why u chose this over others?\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages? What are the technical challenges u faced?\nEx: Why REST APIs? Why GraphQL when there is REST? Why go? Why AWS Lambda and not some other AWS service? etc\nPhase 2:\nIt was a problem-solving round.\nThe interviewer was not being very clear about the requirements of the problem so it took really some time to understand the problem. So, I suggest u to understand the problem by repeatedly asking clarifying questions.\nYou are given an initial string. The problem is to find the longest matching prefix for each string in a long list of strings.\nI told him about KMP algorithm and discussed different other algorithms as well. But, he was keen on knowing what DATA STRUCTURE I would use.\nFinally, I got it. We need to use a TRIE to get prefix for each string. Actually, I asked for a hint and he said that don't worry about memory, Assume we have lots of memory at our disposal. Trie immediately clicked in my mind.\nHe seemed very happy at my answer. He didn't tell me to implement Trie. (But one should be always ready for that).\nPhase 3:\nAfter the first 2 phases, he asked me about my favorite subjects.\nI answered: Algorithms, Data structures, and Operating Systems. He told me that we have already tested your algo & ds skills. Let's move to Operating systems.\nThe key point was : I am highly interested in OS and have read Silberschatz from front to back. I guess that's the reason I didn't face much difficulty in this phase.\nQuestions:\nWhich OS does u use as a CS engineer?\nLinux. Ubuntu.\nWhy Linux? Tell me about Linux.\nLinux is open-source OS. It is based on Monolithic kernel architecture and uses CFS scheduling algorithm which employs RB trees.\nMultiple follow-up questions on:\nMonolithic VS Microkernel\nExample of microkernel\nWindows vs Linux\nDifferences between Process and Thread?\nKernel space vs Userspace?\nVirtual memory?\nSwapping? How does the virtual memory map to physical memory?\nHow do processes communicate? Shared memory & message passing?\nDevice drivers?\nThe interview was scheduled for 1 hr but it went for 1hr 20 mins or more. But, it was very interesting and I loved discussing concepts with the interviewer.\nHR Round:\nThe final round was an HR round.\nI must admit that he was the coolest guy I have ever met with. He introduced himself and asked me to introduce it as well.\nHis communication skill was amazing and we had a really good 2-way conversation going along.\nQuestions:\nSummarize your Engineering journey.\nWhat is the thing you would like to change about your college?\nWhat is the biggest failure in your life? How did u overcome that? Do u regret it?\nHow do your personal values align with that of Atlassian?\nWhat role does u love to play in a team?\nQuestions I asked the interviewer:\nHow Atlassian differs from other companies?\nThe points he talked we really helpful and exciting.\nWhat are the opportunities I would have at Atlassian?\nThere are a hell lot of opportunities.\nIt was an amazing experience. The interviewer was very calm and understanding.\nThis concludes my experience with Atlassian. Hope this article helps to get an understanding of the interview process at Atlassian.\nAll the best!!\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAtlassian Interview Experience""}]",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/winner-of-an-election-where-votes-are-represented-as-candidate-names-1587115621--162858/1?page=1&company=Adobe&sortBy=latest,2025-06-11T12:09:21.357981,GeeksforGeeks,Winner of an election,Easy,80.95%,168+,Not available,"Given a lowercase string array arr[].

Describe a scenario in which deadlock occurs and a solution to overcome it. 3. Given an array, find the maximum difference between two array elements A[m] and A[n], such that n>m. 4. The relation between group of friends is transitive. So if student A is friends with student B, and B is friends with C, A becomes friends with C. They form a circle of friends. Given a matrix N*N and N students, each matrix entry indicating 'Y' or 'N' if they're friends or if they're not friends. We need to determine the number of circles. Eg - 6 students, A,B,C,D,E,F. A is friends with B, B with C. D is friends with E. F is friends with none. Output : 3 circles. F2F Round 1: Starting with Java basics : 1. Uses of final, string pool concept, serialization, synchronization (how it can be done) 2. How can you implement thread pool executor. 3. Is it possible to declare final variable in abstract class. 4. What is externalization. Android : Lots of basic questions: You need to provide more area for checking/unchecking checkbox than the default area of checkbox. How would you do it. How would you implement zoom in zoom out functionality in Android. How do you implement GCM push notifications. What things would you do in each lifecycle method of activity? What is IllegalStateException in Android? Any scenario when you encounter it and how to solve it? Advantages and disadvantages of using fragment. How would you implement swipe animation in Android. How do you detect whether keyboard is open in an Android app. And some more. But I don't exactly remember. DS: Implement queue using 2 stacks. After this, the interviewer seemed satisfied with my responses. F2F Round 2 : Android design questions: 1. You have a textview(3 lines) and a button below it. On clicking the button textview whole content should show. (Content is very large but due to 3 lines initially its not shown completely). You need to add animation while showing the full text of textview. How would you design this. 2. Some question related to showing images (for adult and child, like in flight booking system, we have 2 buttons for adding and removing adults/child). When there is 1 adult and 1 child, it should show as AC where A and C are icons for adult and child. On adding 1 more adult, it should show as AAC instead of ACA. How would you design such a system.

Round 1: Online (30 min) The first round was conducted online,which consisted of MCQ\'s covering C, C++, OS, DBMS. We had to answer 20 questions, and yes there was a negative marking (-0.25) for each wrong answer. Around 650 people took the online test and 75 people were selected for the next round. Round 2: Paper Coding (1 hr) We were asked to code the following questions on paper: 1. Print shortest path to print a string on screen 2. Find zeroes to be flipped so that number of consecutive 1’s is maximized 3. Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree Out of the 75 people who took this test 20 were shortlisted.

There was no guarantee of how much data is read through the socket (i.e. the first time 5 characters may be read, the second time 20 characters may be read). The data to be read consisted of an HTTP header and a message to be displayed. The header was separated from the header by means of a delimiter(here it was ""000|"" ). I had to write a code which discards the HTTP header and displays the message alone considering the fact that there was no way of finding out how many characters were read by the socket. She concluded by asking about my projects.\nRound 4: F2F interview(1.30 hrs) The interview asked me to code the following questions:\n Trapping Rain Water\n Given a linked list and an integer \'k\', I had to rotate the linked list.(Note: Reversing a linked list is different) Input : 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10 and k=4 Output: 4->1->2->3-> 8->5->6->7->9->10\n He gave me a string represented by a binary tree(each leaf node is a character) and a random function that might swap any number of internal nodes of the binary tree(just like mirror). I had to find out if the string (represented by the tree)returned after the randomized function call is a valid permutation of the original string. Eg: Input: ""golden"" and ""gloned"" where gloned is the string returned after calling randomized function. Output: True Input: ""golden"" and ""gnlode"" Output: False\nRound 5: F2F interview(1.30 hrs) The interviewer gave me two scenarios and asked me to write an algorithm for both. Scenario 1: I had to reach Paris from Chennai by flight. He wanted me to find the best possible way to reach Paris. I told him that I would use Djikstra\'s algorithm based on distance, one solution based on time and one solution based on both distance and time(using weighted averages). He then asked me to minimize the number of points to be considered at each intermediate vertex. I told him to use the latitude and longitude to find the direction of the destination and consider points accordingly. He then asked me to draw a line between the source and destination and asked me to consider only points which were inside an inclination of 30 degrees of the line drawn. I gave him a solution and he was satisfied. Scenario 2: He asked me to assume there were 100 airports in my city and he asked me to suggest an algorithm for choosing the airport given the destination and the timings of each flight at each airport. He then asked me to incorporate the significance of ""traffic"" while I travel from my current location to the airport and asked me to design accordingly. He asked me if I had any questions for him, to which I posed a lot of questions regarding the company\'s structure, clients and any pre-requisites to be learnt before I could join the company. The results were anounced later in the evening and I got selected!!!\nAll Practice Problems for Accolite !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nAccolite Interview Experience | Set 13 (On-Campus for Internship and FTE)'}, {'title': 'Vmware Interview Experience Set 3', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vmware-interview-experience-set-3/', 'content_summary': 'I had interview with VMWare.

Other basic algo questions i forgot. Round-2 F2F Interview I was interviewed for vcloud team so they asked me below questions 1) What is cloud ? Why cloud ? Advantages of cloud ? Challenges in cloud ? 2) My project Then started on algos 3) Reverse every k nodes in linked list Write working code 4) Reverse the elements in stack-inplace. No extra memory should be used. I wrote iterative solution code but interviewer asked me to write recursive solution One more round is supposed to happen after this but the interviewer was not available so it was cancelled. Have not heard any response from VMWare i also thought of not troubling them. Tips In telephonic round they are not bothered about time complexity of your algo. They just wanted to know if you can code whatever you think. So if you do not find best solution also it is OK but write the code for average case at-least.\nAll Practice Problems for VMWare !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nVMWare Interview Experience | Set 3'}, {'title': 'Paytm Interview Experience Set 4 Walk In Drive', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paytm-interview-experience-set-4-walk-in-drive/', 'content_summary': 'I got a chance to participate in walk-in drive at Paytm Headquarters.

Ex:- [2,4,6,6,4,2,10], for this the answer is 4, i.e. [2,4,6,6,4,2],[4,6,6,4,2,10],[4,6,6,4],[6,6].

There were three questions:\nGiven a nxm matrix filled with all 0s and 1s, find the biggest subsquare which has all 1s in it. Done it using Dynamic Programming\nReverse a linked list in a group. Ex: 1→2→3→4→5→6→NULL with k=3 then the output must be 3→2→1→6→5→4→NULL.\nThe tough question for me and the reason I couldn't get selected (I think that's the reason) Given an array with numbers in it, you will have n number of queries, each query will have 3 inputs x, y, val where x and y represents the start and end indices of a subarray whose all elements must be increased by a value 'val' and then there would be n queries again where each query will have x and y where each query must be returned with the sum of the subarray [x index to y index] of the updated array. At first glance, everyone would say that just add every time a query has been sent but then there would be no point of asking. So, I said I would use union and intersection of the indices and somehow get to the answer and so he asked how to find union and intersection and that's where I toppled and couldn't answer and that's it they said ok and I left.

The functions should put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers. 2nd Round : - Given an array of size N that contains values in the range [1 N-1], find All missing numbers Do each in O(n). with Working code. HINT : By making it negative. - How to implement LRU caching scheme? What data structures should be used? Was able to answer the LRU cache with discussion, but when i was writing its code, he got confused, told me to give only algo/ steps. Not seems to be convinced. HR told me that review is Good for everything but not that LRU code. I told her Interviewer got confused. So she arranged another round of interview. 3rd Round : Very Nice Guys, Good knowledge give you a lot of confidence. - How will trigger notification at exact time/date. Not using Alarm api. - String buffer String builder, How to make class immutable. - Suppose One Class A, which has a member variable Class B. You have to make class variable immutable.

Firstly, they presented a pre-placement-talk where they talked about their work culture, their biggest clients, their intra, fests, etc. The work life aspect was discussed too. \n\nFollowing this, they conducted Online test for 30 min that included MCQ questions from \nC, C++ : finding o/p, complexity, bugs if any \nDBMS: Join queries, indexing and theory \nOS and Networks: Basic theory Networking \nand Little Quantitative Aptitude. \nAround 200 Students appeared for this round. 11 were shortlisted for first round interviews. I got through this round. For the next top 10, a coding round of pen/paper (1 hour) was carried out from where only 2 were shortlisted. There were three questions as narrated by my friends. One on tries, one on heap, one on sorting. Thus, 13 people made it for technical interviews. \n\nRound 1 FFS : 1 hour \nThe two interviewers congratulated me for reaching this far. \n\n1) After a little introduction, they threw me a puzzle. 3 _ 1 _ 3 _ 6 = 8. I had to fill the spaces with any operator I can, to satisfy the equality. I thought for about 5 mins. Then I gave the following: (3 ^ 1) & 3 + 6. They were happy with the not so conventional approach but directed me towards a simpler construction. See if you can find it yourself \n\n2) Then followed a barrage of sql queries, probably as I had mentioned databases in my resume. I suggest everyone to practice join queries. \n\n3) Next question was to detect the merging point of two linked lists with length m and n. I initially gave the hashmap solution which he asked me to code. Then he asked for other less expensive ways. I reduced problem into finding the start node of a loop, if modification was allowed, otherwise, advancing the longer by the difference between the two lengths. Full working code was required along with the time and space complexities. \n\n4) Another question was to find a triplet in the array that sums to a particular value. \nAfter this, I was notified to get ready for round 2. Five folks were eliminated. \n\nRound 2 FFS: 2 hours \n1) Given a huge array consisting of integers in a certain range. How would you solve the queries of the following type : Report the number of integers lying in the range between l to r. I built a prefix array as in the counting sort. Now all queries could be answered in O(1). He modified the question by stating that the range now was always a multiple of some number. I proceeded by dividing the i/p into buckets and then building the prefix array. Full code was asked. \n\n2) Given a huge numbers of strings in an arraylist, report the longest common prefix of the strings. I solved this by creating a trie with an augmented node storing depth and count at each node. Only the important modules were asked to be coded. \n\n3) Short discussion of my summer internship, why I used JAVA, what challenges did I face. He asked me to explain the differences between treeMap, linkedHashMap and hashMap. \n\n4) I had mentioned a project carried out on Linux Mint. He asked me the basic commands of linux, namely cat, grep, ps, df along with syntax for git commands. \n\n5) Assume a traveller wants to books a cab. Write an automated server that schedules a cab present in the region pool of the user in a way that maximizes the benefit to the company. You can make assumptions like GPS availability. At first, I had no clue where I was heading. Then I broke down the problem into structures and assumed the necessary. This was more of a discussion sort of thing, as this had no definitive answer. I had to write the pseudocode of anything I thought. 30 mins went straight into this question. \n\n6) Core JAVA Questions. 7-8 of them including but not limited to new operator, constructor, static blocks, synchronized keywords etc. \n3 were eliminated. I got through to round 3. \n\nRound 3: FFS 1:15 hours \nThe interviewer greeted and informed me of this round being a techno-managerial round. \n1) You are the manager of a restaurant. Given the archives of past purchases of raw materials per day of the week, write an algorithm that forecasts the amount of each raw material to be purchased so as to cover the next week requirements. Mention data structures used, if any. After thinking for a while, I proceeded by the method of weighted averages, assigned more weight to weekends over weekdays, special diets etc. I said, I being the manager would use the trend adjustment factor to forecast the next demand (economics helped Explained this using an example. \n\n2) Given an i/p stream of train coaches in the following format: XY where X: uppercase letter, Y: a number, what is the most efficient way to sort the coaches such that at the end of the stream, we can get the sorted order in O(1). eg. A3, B2, C10, A1 -> o/p A1, A3, B2, C10. \nAlso prove why comparison sorts have a lower bound of O(nlogn) where n is the size of the input. \n\n3) How do you delete an arbitrary item from a heap. Write the code. Even the redundant lines in my code were subjected to scrutiny. \nI wasn't confident of my performance in this round, but stayed positive. It had been 10 hours of waiting. \n\nHR Round(15 mins) \nThe HR Ma'am was very friendly. Asked me what I knew about the company so far. I had a feeling I was being tested for my listening skills against the morning pre-placement presentation. \n\nI would like to thanks geeksforgeeks for their content that helped me through. A word of advice: Practice pen and paper codes. Never lie on your resume, it may back-fire at any moment.

(at Noida) \nDS Questions:- First question was to write a code of finding an intersection point in the merged linked lists, first I gave the stack based approach then optimized with the hashtable based approach. \nNext question was to find the pairs of numbers which make a given sum in the given array , only the approach was asked, so initially I gave loop based approach then optimized it with a hashing. Just then he asked me to find triplets which could make a sum as zero. \nThen third question was to find the minimum length section of an array which could be sorted to make the whole array as sorted , this was a little bit tricky, but the interviewer was helpful in giving couple of hints. \n\nCS Fundamentals:- \nI mentioned in my introduction that I am proficient in Java so he asked me some basic questions like difference between abstract class and interface and questions like what is inheritance how it is useful . There were also some questions on OS. \n\nTechnical Round 2:- \nHe asked me the working of google maps, what is the algorithm behind that and how would I implement it and if I need to find out the nearby clinics then what is the best way to do that. Then he asked me difference between BFS and DFS which one is better for the above functionality. Then he asked me a random question that GPS would work without internet or not. Then I was asked to code random number generating function which does not generates a pregenerated number twice. Then a couple of questions related to my projects. \nThen he asked OS questions, like what is Thrashing and how to prevent it, if you are rich then would you buy a 500 gb ram, if no why?( my ans-No, as Searching in ram then will become a costly operation) then there were questions on Paging, TLB, Virtual memory, Logical address etc. \n\nTechnical Round 3:- \nFirst he asked me about my projects(in detail this time), then he gave me a system design problem, to design a lift management system with multiple lifts and write the classes required tothe same, his main focus was on to find an algorithm to allocate lift so as to minimize the waiting time spent by a person.Firstly he asked me to find all the edge cases like if 2 lifts are equally far \nfrom a requesting floors then how will you allocate, so after a heavy discussion he asked me to write the code. \nThen some non-technical questions were asked like what would you change in your past in your education and why. \n\nHR Round:- \nIt was just a 10 min round.He asked general questions about the college placements then if I already had any offer and its details.Then I asked him that whether freshers are hired for purely research work in Adobe and if not then what is the procedure to get there. \n\nTips:- \nMake sure you brush up your CS fundamentals(especially OS and the language in which you are proficient ). They watch you throughout the day, even if you are sitting outside the interview hall, so be aware of that. It is ok not to answer all the questions correctly, you might go wrong with some but don’t let that demoralize or demotivate you as you need to be energetic till the end. \n\nAll the best!!\n \nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAdobe Interview Experience (5 Rounds)'}]",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/intersection-point-in-y-shaped-linked-lists--170645/1?page=1&company=Adobe&sortBy=latest,2025-06-11T12:12:36.914929,GeeksforGeeks,Intersection Point in Y Shaped Linked Lists,Medium,55.77%,29K+,Not available,"Given two singly linked lists, write a program to get the point where two linked lists intersect each other.

Computer science/communication/electronics\nEach round consisted of 20 questions of 1 mark each to be finished in 30 minutes. There was a negative marking of .25 per question.\nFirst section consisted of not so tough aptitude questions along with few quant, word coding and logical reasoning questions.\nSecond section completely consisted of C output based questions. Most of them were time consuming bit manipulation questions ( almost 70 percent).\nIn Third section we had to choose the paper according to our profile, for me which was CS. Very few OS questions compared to other written tests which I heard Qualcomm organized in past years. Most questions were from C, OOPS , few from DS.\nResult was announced after one day, after the pre-placement talk by the company. Out of 153, 73 were selected for face to face interviews.\nIn my first technical round, he asked me:\nTo give my introduction and explain my projects.\n1. Find loop in a linked list and find the length of that loop.\n2. Mutex vs. Semaphore and their implementation\n3. Virtual memory and paging\n4. Stack vs. Heap and their content\n5. Thrashing and how can we avoid it.\n6. Memory mapping\n7. Threading concept and how stack behave in multi-threading environment and few pThread concepts\n8. Page fault and steps followed to handle it\n9. Deadlock and its avoidance\n10. One puzzle: If we have three boxes each with two balls which can be either black or white are named wrong. Their name is such that it signifies the first letter of each ball’s color, which the box contained. For example a box containing a white and a black ball should have name: bb. But unfortunately all boxes are named wrongly. Find the minimum number of ball to be extracted to find out correct name of each box. Condition: each ball that is taken out should be replaced to the same box.\nThen he asked me ask any questions if I had. I asked three.\nMy interview was for 30 minutes. After first round 43 candidates were selected for next technical round. The questions he asked me in this round were:\n1. Inline function, why we should use them, if they are so good why not make every function inline\n2. How normal function call is implemented (OS perspective)\n3. Steps that is followed when an Interrupt occurs (OS perspective)\n4. Given few cases and asked how interrupt will affect their execution.\n5. Given a code without Mutex and ask to give an execution flow of thread that will give wrong result\n4. Can’t we share data without mutex. Give examples of any scenario you support\n6. Compiler stages with brief explanation about each\n7. Make file and multiple file program compilation and execution.\n8. How compiler does intermediate code optimization and few examples of them.\n9. Static linking and dynamic linking, how they are implemented and examples of both\n10. Extern variable and function\nMy this round lasted for 35 minutes. After first round 32 candidates were selected for HR round. The question he asked me in this round were:\nAll based on the CV. He was asking question for each word present in CV. Many stress testing questions and background questions. He asked me about which of my written test section went not so good and why. He also asked me about relocation. He then asked me to ask any question if I have. I asked few.

There was no negative marking. Paper Coding round 21 students were shortlisted from the 1st MCQ round and in this round we were asked to write the codes (function only) of 3 questions in 1 hour time. Q1. You are given a matrix of size MxN and only possible values in the matrix are 0 - representing empty position 1 – representing a fresh apple 2 – representing a rotten apple A rotten apple converts all the fresh apples to rotten ones which are adjacent to it in 1 unit of time. Given an input the matrix and you have to calculate the amount of time in which all the fresh apples become rotten. Also determine whether all fresh apples could be made rotten in finite time or not. (20 marks) Input 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 0 2 1 After 1 time unit, the matrix will be transformed to 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 1 0 0 2 2 After 2 time units the matrix will look like 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 Hence output should be 2 time units. (Definition of adjacent only included the left , right, bottom and upper cell and NOT diagonal cell) Q2. You are given a Binary tree and you need to find out the maximum path sum between any 2 leaf nodes of the binary tree (The maximum path sum may or may not pass through root of tree). To be done in O(n) time (20 marks) Q3. You are given an unsorted array of integers and you need to find out whether there exists a majority element in it. (Majority element is one which appears more than n/2 times in an array of size n). To be done in O(n) time (10 Marks) The result of this round was declared late in the night. Some 7 or 8 students were called for the face to face interview rounds. I was the first one to be called and F2F rounds started at 11.30 PM and ended up in 5 AM in the morning :-p I was lucky to be free around 1.15 AM Face 2 Face Round 1 Q1. I couldn’t complete my Paper coding round question 1 (rotten apples). She (the interviewer) asked me to rectify the problem in it. I did it with the help of MxN extra space for visited[][] matrix. She said do it inplace. I did by modifying the Matrix values to 3 , 4 , etc. Q2. Find 5th from last element in a singly linked list. Firstly I gave a solution which took two traversals. She said to do it in 1 traversal only. I did it by taking two pointers and maintaining a distance of 5 nodes between them. Q3. You are given a string for example if input string is “I am abc xyz”. Output should be the modified string as “xyz abc am I” .This was to be done inplace and in O(n) time. Q4. You are given a unsorted array of both positive and negative integers. You need to find out the maximum sum subarray in O(n) time. You need to find the start and ending indexes along with the sum. Q5. You are given a BST and two keys k1 and k2. You need to find out the lowest common ancestor of the two keys Iteratively. I suggested the solution of storing the path in a vector and finding the 1st mismatch of key value in the root to k1 and root t k2 path. Face to Face round 2 Q1. Take the example of paper coding round rotten apples question and suggest some algorithm where you are allowed to change the position of rotten and fresh apples in such a way that the resultant matrix converts least number of fresh apples to rotten apples. I suggested an approach where I would first count the number of rotten and fresh apples initially and arrange all fresh apples in a sub-matrix starting from (0, 0) position and similarly arrange all rotten apples in sub-matrix from (N-1, M-1) position. He was satisfied with this approach Q2. You are given an elevator system with 3 elevators, you have to suggest some algorithm in which the amount of time that a person waiting on some x floor and has pressed the up or down button should wait for least amount of time and also the person inside the elevator also should not wait for too long to reach his destination floor. Q3. Asked some general questions as to what are tokens of a language. What is a grammar and production rules. Then he asked me to check whether a given code in some language is syntactically correct or not. You are provided the set of valid tokens for this language and also symbol table. Q4. You are given a text file storing characters or words. Suggest some way to compress the file such that there is always some amount of space compression possible. I suggested to use a trie tree as all the prefixes will share the space. He said this approach is dependent on whether the input has common prefixes or not. Suggest some other way. I then said that we can use Huffman Encoding and assign smallest code to most frequent word in the file and so on. He said again this approach also is dependent on whether your input has frequently occurring words or not. Then I suggested that since all characters can be represented in terms of 8 bits or 1 byte. We can take the XOR of prev and next character and store it in the current character position. This way I would be able to always get a n/2 size reduction in the encoded file. The idea was similar to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-linked-list-a-memory-efficient-doubly-linked-list-set-1/ He was satisfied and this was the end of my 2nd F2F round. He told me to get some sleep because you will be having a skype interview with our technical manager followed by HR round in the morning. 3rd round (Skype) Q1. He asked me to define NP and NP hard problems followed by the definition of automata and regular language. He then asked me are regular expressions. Q2. He shared a google doc with me and gave me a regular expression like abab*(a|b) and an input string s. I needed to write a code to check whether the given input string could be generated from this regular expression or not. Return a Boolean true or false value. I coded it up in 5 minutes :-p Q3. You are given a N-ary tree and a value K. You need to return true if there exists some root to leaf path having sum = k and false otherwise. I did it using recursion and in O(n) time. He told me that you’ll be having your final HR round in some time. I knew that I was going well because he seemed to be quite satisfied with my answers. Final HR round That was the round for which I’ve been waiting for hours She (the HR) started off with some general questions like tell me about yourself and your aims and goals in life. What are your hobbies. I told her that I love art and craft. She asked me what will I make for her if tomorrow is her birthday :-p She was very friendly and nice to talk to. It didn’t seem that I was talking to the HR. It was more like talking to a friend. She asked me what I liked about Accolite and why do I wish to join the company and stuff. Finally we discussed about the pay-scale and work culture in Accolite.\nRelated Practice Problems\nXOR Linked List\nMaximum path sum\nMajority Element\nn'th node from end of linked list\nLowest Common Ancestor in a BST\nReverse words in a given string\nKadane's Algorithm\nRotten Oranges\nAll Practice Problems for Accolite !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nAccolite Interview Experience | Set 3 (On-Campus)""}, {'title': 'Adobe Interview Experience For Mts 1 2', 'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adobe-interview-experience-for-mts-1-2/', 'content_summary': 'First, there was an online round on cocubes of 1 hr 30 min. 1hr was for aptitude which consisted of 60 questions(mental ability, comprehensive, reasoning) and next 30 min was for 2 coding questions that were very basic. Accuracy required in aptitude as coding questions were done by all and aptitude made all the difference. Candidates shortlisted were called for interview in their office. Round 1: \nFirst, he asked me to brief about yourself and there was a long discussion about my projects and their applications. As I mentioned the github link for all the projects, he visited my profile and checked my repositories and asked about github and the tools I have used.\nDetect the loop in the linked list and then find the point from where the loop started. he then asked to write the code. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1\nSearch in row-wise and column wise sorted matrix. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix17201720/1  he emptied some cells in the matrix and asked how to insert the number in the matrix. only logic was required.\nWhat are threads and processes?

Is communication possible between two threads of two different processes? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-thread-communication-java/   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication/\nRound 2:\nFirst the small introduction and then he asked to rate my favorite(java) programming language.\nAgain the same question of the linked list was asked in the 2nd round but this time he asked me to prove my solution. Proof of solution of slow and fast pointer concept to find the meeting point was asked. He wants me to answer that the point where slow and fast pointer meets is the midpoint of the whole linked list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1\nFind the nth node from the end of a linked list and write the code. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nth-node-from-end-of-linked-list/1\nPostorder traversal of a tree and code it.\nDifference between mutex and semaphore. Difference between the mutex and binary semaphore.\nAt last, a long discussion of about 45min on the implementation of hashmap was held. He made a class where hashcode method and equals method of object class was overridden. the object of the class was the key and many values were put in the hashmap and the output was asked along with the size of an array used in a hashmap and then their time complexity. He changed the implementation of the above 2 methods 4 times and then asked the same questions. For Ex, if hashcode return 1 and equals method return true always then every time value is overwritten and size of an array is 1 and complexity is O(1) as the complexity of hashcode and equals method is O(1).\nThen again discussion continued on hashmap. Given a class of city which contains all the malls in it and a class of mall which contains cities in which it is present. what should be done to make both city and mall to act as a key of the hashmap. Here runtime polymorphism was used where a base class was made with equals and hashcode method which is inherited by both city and mall class. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internal-working-of-hashmap-java/\nRound 3:\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-by-90-degree-1587115621/1\nif you have a directory of many files then how will you find the duplicate files or which data structure is best for performing that search of duplicate files. Ans: hashmap. this technique is used by WhatsApp to remove all the duplicate messages like forwarded messages.\nHe scanned my resume and asked me to detail about my all the projects and many questions were asked related to it. All the technical problems faced etc.\nAs I was the vice-captain of volleyball so he asked about the duties of a captain. Is it possible to have a captain and a vice-captain not in playing six?\nRound 4 (HR): General discussion. The evaluation was not done in this round. Asked me about good and bad of adobe. He explained everything about Adobe its culture its spread its new technologies. My Feedback from previous interviewers was discussed. Finally, I got the offer.
