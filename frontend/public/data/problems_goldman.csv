color[i] is the color of the i-th ball.
radius[i] is the radius of the i-th ball.
If two consecutive balls have the same color and radius, remove them both. Repeat this process until no more such pairs exist.
Return the number of balls remaining after all possible removals.
Examples:
Input: color[] = [2, 3, 5], radius[] = [3, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: All the 3 balls have different colors and radius.
Input: color[] = [2, 2, 5], radius[] = [3, 3, 5]
Output: 1
Explanation: First ball and second ball have same color 2 and same radius 3. So, after removing only one ball is left. It cannot be removed from the array. Hence, the final array has length 1.

The entire interview procedure was divided into a coding round and a set of 4 face to face interview. Online coding round: It was a 90 minutes test with 22 questions(20 MCQs + 2 coding) set hosted on HackerRank. Coding questions: 1. Reverse words in a string. Example: Let the input string be “i like this program very much”. The function should change the string to “much very program this like i” 2. Largest length of subarray with given sum. MCQs consisted of OS, Geometry, Basic Maths, C ,Recursion and such topics. Whoever solved atleast two questions were chosen for the interviews. F2F 1(Technical): He asked me about my Summer Internship Project at Microsoft India Development Centre, Hyderabad and asked me about several technologies involved in it and why I had used certain things. Then he moved on to two technical questions. 1. Given a sorted and pivoted array, find an element given to you. I had given him a O(logn) solution with pivot finding and then doing binary search in either halves. But it was a O(logn) + O(logn), so he asked me to modify it to a one O(logn) question. After giving him the solution, he asked me to write production level code considering all corner test cases. 2. Given a BST which consists of marks of students in a class. It is found that all even ranked students have cheated,so we reduce k marks from their score. Modify the BST to make the change of marks without considering that after this operation, the BST might not remain a BST anymore. I gave him a modified inorder traversal so that elements are sorted and solved it using a counter variable. He asked me to modify it to using neither a static counter variable nor a pointer passed to the recursive calls. For both questions, he also asked me the time and space complexity. F2F 2(Technical): He asked a very brief idea about my Summer Internship again. Then he asked me 2 questions again. 1.Given a k sized window in an array,find max element in each window. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/ I discussed a lot with him as to which data structure could be used and finally came up with a Queue solution. I was asked to code it again considering all the corner cases. 2.Implement a queue using stacks with the operations (Enqueue,Dequeue,IsEmpty,Size). While I was telling him the solution,he even asked me whether I would prefer Arrays or Linked List implementation when i make a normal queue. (Space and time complexity for both) F2F 3(Technical): He also asked me a brief introduction to my Summer Internship Project. He began with the pros of cons or arrays and linked lists. Then a question on arrays: 1. Given an array with all even elements present even number of times except one which is present odd number of times. Find that element. I started with XOR solution, but he told me the OS doesn’t support XOR. So, I gave him a HashMap solution. He went on asking me to optimize further. So at the end I had a space complexity of O(k) where k= number of unique elements. Asked me the Space and Time complexity of the most optimized solution. 2. Given four types of array\n a)Increasing(1,2,3,4)\n b)Decreasing(4,3,2,1)\n c)Increasing-decreasing(1,2,3,4,7,6,5)\n d)Decreasing-increasing(7,6,5,1,2,3,4) \nFind the type of array in O(1) and then find the maximum element in the array. Except case c, max element is O(1). For c, I gave binary search solution. he asked me to write the code considering the corner cases. F2F 4(Bar raiser): He asked me what my favorite subject was. I told DS,so he asked me from DS. 1. Write a class of circular queue using array implementation with Enqueue and Dequeue member functions. 2. Given a binary matrix( filled with 0 and 1 only) where 0 depicts water and 1 depicts land. We can traverse either up or down or left or right.Given a source and destination,find if we can reach the destination. He then modified it to finding the path followed and then the minimum path possible. (Code wasn\'t required) 3. Given a series of operations to build a project along with the time taken by each operation. Some operations are dependent on previous operations. Find the minimum number of days needed to finish the operation. I wasn\'t very sure of the solution I was thinking,so he said it was okay and concluded the interview. Tips: 1. Keep sharing your idea with the interviewer, he would help you a lot. 2. Don’t give up, you might come up with a brilliant idea with a little more thinking. And do remember: ""If it doesn\'t end well then it probably hasn\'t ended yet"" I would like to thank all my friends for all the support and a special thanks to GeeksForGeeks for their awesome website.

(b)-Evaluation of post fix expression. Note - Only fight for solving atleast one coding question.If you have not done any coding question then it doesn't matter how many MCQ you have done you can not qualify for next round. I had started with coding question and did 1 question and only 10 MCQ and qualified for next round. 21 candidates were shortlisted. Round 2(Face to Face)(30 min): Introduce yourself -(Just a formality) Asked about test and discussed coding question.(Must solve all coding questions before appearing in interview). Then 2nd question - 1- print a binary tree diagonally.I told him the algo within 2 min then he asked me to write complete code (specially mentioned not pseudo code). It might contain some syntax error but it was not much of a concern. They only see whether are you able to implement the algo properly. Then he told me there was an error in the code and that it doesn't go correctly to next line. I told him it's correct lets run manually and check. The code was correct. 2-Subarray with 0 sum I knew its solution and answered the best solution immediately. He asked me if I had done the question previously. I told not exactly same but I like competitive coding so I have done similar question. Then he extended this question and asked to print all sub-array with some some zero.(write proper code). Then he discussed corner cases I told some then he gave some hint and after that I got the idea so, answered all corner cases. Some questions asked from my friends-> 1-Given an array A[] and a number x, check for pair in A[] with sum as x 2-Find a pair with given target in BST (expect inorder and reverse inorder solution) 3-Maximum width of a binary tree 4-Next larger element 5-Spirally traversing a matrix Note- Same questions were asked by the same interviewer to many candidates so it is advisable to share questions with friends as they select you for next round only if you have done both of the questions. 9 people were shortlisted in this round. Round 3(nearly 2 hours)- 1-Given a stream of number how you will maintain top 10 element. Whenever asked, the answer should be top 10 element till now. (answered in 2 min using min-heap). 2-Alien Dictionary very tough question. In 1 hour with the hint of interviewer I was able to answer this. 3- Some basic C questions - What is difference b/w Malloc, Calloc. Scenario when to use which one. 4- Data structure to use for undo and redo in text editor. I took a lot of time but finally told its answer i.e. stack. 5- Lowest common ancestor of binary tree.(Proper code) After this round 7 candidates were selected.

This was a medium level question, 7/11 test case passed using brute force (O(n^2)). An accurate solution of which is actually in O (n), but i modified my code and managed to get all the 11 test cases right using just a slight modification in my brute force approach! \n\nQ3)A matrix was given, the solution to which was by applying  BFS on it but not exactly that.

Time complexity of which was O(nlogk) ! \n\nQ3)Circular tour \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/circular-tour/1\n\n For this question i gave him a more optimized solution than brute force but with the same complexity, but he did not give me much time for this question as they were running late on schedule. \n\nLater I got to know from sources that I was rated 3.7 out of 5 in this round, which was more than a lot of others. \n\nRound 3: TECHNICAL   II \n\n17 out of 22 made it to this round. \n\nIn this round the questions asked were tough, but the interviewer was very suggestive and kept dropping hints. \n\nQ1)Sum of minimum elements of all sub arrays. \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-minimum-elements-of-all-subarrays/ \n\nI gave an immediate solution in nlogn time, but he asked me to optimize it. He gave me hell a lot of hints but I could not solve this easy question.

He asked me to write the code for it and tell me what algo was I using. I did write a rough algo just enough to give him a clear idea of what was I thinking and he was satisfied with that ! \nAnd we moved on to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ3) LRU cache implementation using array, stack/queue, doubly linked list, circular linked list, Hash map. \nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1\n\nI did them all very easily, and I also told him the story why was I good at it. He was happy enough to let me go again stating that time was a constrain and they had to take further interviews too ! \n\n  \n\nRound 4: HIRING MANAGER ROUND \n\nI was pretty confident that if I make it till here, I will get the job too, which is what happened. \nI entered the room, He asked me ""How was I "" and I told him"" I was hungry""......that did set the tone of the interview to a casual talk and made him comfortable with me. 5-10 mins into the interview, he commented that I was very honest. ANd so went on the conversation and the usual interview Questions. \n\nWhere do you see yourselves in 5 years? \n\nWhat is your strength and weakness? To which I answered as hard working, being both my weakness and strength and justified it . \n\nHe asked me about my story if JEE and getting into this college. \n\nHow did I grow technically and personality wise in the last 3 years? \n\nand usual questions like that ....to which I gave pretty interesting answers ! \n\nWe then discussed a little about any one of my projects of my choice and I some how led that discussion to about how every college group project is like one person doing the entire work, to him I also told that in one of the projects I did the entire work  and everyone got the credit, and how once in second year my partner did the entire project and I got pointers for it too. He was convinced that I was very honest and true !! \n\nAt last he asked me if I had any questions for him . \n\nI asked him only one question, which was that just in case if I get selected for this job at flipkart or even if I do not, what is that one thing that I should improve or learn about my technical part or my personality part. He did not say anything about my technical skills, He only said that he got a picture that I was not passionate enough . I also joined hands and agreed on it and gave a little justification on it. He also said that  I should not take that personally and that he only siad that because I asked so. \n\nThat is where the HM round ended. I got up, we shook hands and he said that mine was the best HM interview he had in the entire day(my was 2nd last interview of the day), and that he had an interesting conversation with me and truly enjoyed it ! \n\n  \n\nI was on Cloud 7 at the end of this interview. \n\nNext day the results were announced.

GIven a point find the points on the largest line [in terms of the points it contain ] passing through that point Input : 0 1 Output : (0 0 ) (0 1) (0 2 ) (0 3 ) 3. Given 2 points find the points in between them. Input (0 0) (0 3 ) Output : (0 1) (0 2 ) 4. Find the number of points in the line with the largest number of points in it. 5. Given a point print all the lines passing through it [ie for each line print the points in it ] PREPARATION :This round usually consist on making modules and oop stuffs. This was out of the blue. Previous problems, I just did Railway Reservation partially for this round. If you have done some projects and is good with oop you will get through no need to practice specifically for this else brush up your OOP Designing skills and do some previous questions. I solved all the problems. The invigilator will be around checking your code all the time, SO NO SLOPPY CODING GUYS!! They need good code. Take a paper and figure out your aproch before solving each of them. And also check if you could use one problem to solve the other. Here The function written for Q2 can be used for Q5 with some modification if you're out of time. ________________________________________________________________________________ 12 Students cleared round 3. I was one of the top 3 students and was directly taken to HR Round.\nRound 4 Tech 1 :\nI was told they were asked basic questions on arrays, strings and matrix. If they find you are good enough they will send you to HR else there will be another tech round for you with another person.This is the end of the line if you dont impress them here too.\nRound 5 HR : Basic questions.\nNote : Higher studies - say no Why ZOHO projects If you get another company will you come to ZOHO We are gonna have oracle next week so some questions like will you be attending oracle . -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally 8 students got through 6 of them got higher package and 2 of them got lower package. Thank you geeksforgeeks, you guys are the only source that i used to prepare for this test and no way would've cleared without the help from people who posted their experience. My results were announced 3 hours ago and here I am posting the questions. So whoever is prepping for ZOHO, know that previous questions are of absolute importance. Zoho is easy to crack with proper preparation for a 15 days or so. Persistence and consistence is the key here and a bit of luck.

There is a function f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c , apply this function on A where x is any ith element from array A and a,b,c belongs to set of real numbers. Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon. I said Java, Spring MVC for backend and html,css, javascript for front end and suddenly he asked what is difference between Java and javascript. Could not figure out at that time. Javascript is also an object oriented language an can be used at server side like node js.

There was no negative marking. Paper Coding round 21 students were shortlisted from the 1st MCQ round and in this round we were asked to write the codes (function only) of 3 questions in 1 hour time. Q1. You are given a matrix of size MxN and only possible values in the matrix are 0 - representing empty position 1 – representing a fresh apple 2 – representing a rotten apple A rotten apple converts all the fresh apples to rotten ones which are adjacent to it in 1 unit of time. Given an input the matrix and you have to calculate the amount of time in which all the fresh apples become rotten. Also determine whether all fresh apples could be made rotten in finite time or not. (20 marks) Input 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 0 0 2 1 After 1 time unit, the matrix will be transformed to 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 1 0 0 2 2 After 2 time units the matrix will look like 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 Hence output should be 2 time units. (Definition of adjacent only included the left , right, bottom and upper cell and NOT diagonal cell) Q2. You are given a Binary tree and you need to find out the maximum path sum between any 2 leaf nodes of the binary tree (The maximum path sum may or may not pass through root of tree). To be done in O(n) time (20 marks) Q3. You are given an unsorted array of integers and you need to find out whether there exists a majority element in it. (Majority element is one which appears more than n/2 times in an array of size n). To be done in O(n) time (10 Marks) The result of this round was declared late in the night. Some 7 or 8 students were called for the face to face interview rounds. I was the first one to be called and F2F rounds started at 11.30 PM and ended up in 5 AM in the morning :-p I was lucky to be free around 1.15 AM Face 2 Face Round 1 Q1. I couldn’t complete my Paper coding round question 1 (rotten apples). She (the interviewer) asked me to rectify the problem in it. I did it with the help of MxN extra space for visited[][] matrix. She said do it inplace. I did by modifying the Matrix values to 3 , 4 , etc. Q2. Find 5th from last element in a singly linked list. Firstly I gave a solution which took two traversals. She said to do it in 1 traversal only. I did it by taking two pointers and maintaining a distance of 5 nodes between them. Q3. You are given a string for example if input string is “I am abc xyz”. Output should be the modified string as “xyz abc am I” .This was to be done inplace and in O(n) time. Q4. You are given a unsorted array of both positive and negative integers. You need to find out the maximum sum subarray in O(n) time. You need to find the start and ending indexes along with the sum. Q5. You are given a BST and two keys k1 and k2. You need to find out the lowest common ancestor of the two keys Iteratively. I suggested the solution of storing the path in a vector and finding the 1st mismatch of key value in the root to k1 and root t k2 path. Face to Face round 2 Q1. Take the example of paper coding round rotten apples question and suggest some algorithm where you are allowed to change the position of rotten and fresh apples in such a way that the resultant matrix converts least number of fresh apples to rotten apples. I suggested an approach where I would first count the number of rotten and fresh apples initially and arrange all fresh apples in a sub-matrix starting from (0, 0) position and similarly arrange all rotten apples in sub-matrix from (N-1, M-1) position. He was satisfied with this approach Q2. You are given an elevator system with 3 elevators, you have to suggest some algorithm in which the amount of time that a person waiting on some x floor and has pressed the up or down button should wait for least amount of time and also the person inside the elevator also should not wait for too long to reach his destination floor. Q3. Asked some general questions as to what are tokens of a language. What is a grammar and production rules. Then he asked me to check whether a given code in some language is syntactically correct or not. You are provided the set of valid tokens for this language and also symbol table. Q4. You are given a text file storing characters or words. Suggest some way to compress the file such that there is always some amount of space compression possible. I suggested to use a trie tree as all the prefixes will share the space. He said this approach is dependent on whether the input has common prefixes or not. Suggest some other way. I then said that we can use Huffman Encoding and assign smallest code to most frequent word in the file and so on. He said again this approach also is dependent on whether your input has frequently occurring words or not. Then I suggested that since all characters can be represented in terms of 8 bits or 1 byte. We can take the XOR of prev and next character and store it in the current character position. This way I would be able to always get a n/2 size reduction in the encoded file. The idea was similar to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xor-linked-list-a-memory-efficient-doubly-linked-list-set-1/ He was satisfied and this was the end of my 2nd F2F round. He told me to get some sleep because you will be having a skype interview with our technical manager followed by HR round in the morning. 3rd round (Skype) Q1. He asked me to define NP and NP hard problems followed by the definition of automata and regular language. He then asked me are regular expressions. Q2. He shared a google doc with me and gave me a regular expression like abab*(a|b) and an input string s. I needed to write a code to check whether the given input string could be generated from this regular expression or not. Return a Boolean true or false value. I coded it up in 5 minutes :-p Q3. You are given a N-ary tree and a value K. You need to return true if there exists some root to leaf path having sum = k and false otherwise. I did it using recursion and in O(n) time. He told me that you’ll be having your final HR round in some time. I knew that I was going well because he seemed to be quite satisfied with my answers. Final HR round That was the round for which I’ve been waiting for hours She (the HR) started off with some general questions like tell me about yourself and your aims and goals in life. What are your hobbies. I told her that I love art and craft. She asked me what will I make for her if tomorrow is her birthday :-p She was very friendly and nice to talk to. It didn’t seem that I was talking to the HR. It was more like talking to a friend. She asked me what I liked about Accolite and why do I wish to join the company and stuff.

Every student got a different set of questions, mine was:\nIt was a very easy and known question of finding the nth term in a Fibonacci series. \nIt was like an encoding question where we have to change every alphabet of a string to an alphabet which is 3 places ahead in alphabetical order. The question was easy having a slight tricky corner case when we encounter alphabets like x, y, and z.\nIt was based on to validate a given IP Address.\nSince the test was so easy so those were able to solve all three questions and having c.g.p.a greater than 9 were promoted to the next round, around 40 students were selected for face-to-face interviews.\n1st Technical Interview(60-90 min): Since due to covid whole process happened virtually so our interviews took place on Microsoft Teams app, mine started at sharp 9 a.m. in the morning, Interview began with a formal introduction about me and my interviewer, then he started discussing my resume, where I have written a lot of things.\nHe started talking about my projects, recently I participated in the Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon, so I have a good project to explain which benefited me a lot. He asked a lot about tech-stack used in developing the project that was React.js for client interface and Django for server interface and python for ML model, he was well impressed with the way I overcome the problems faced during the course of the project, then without wasting more time on projects he shifted to the languages and new technologies that I mentioned my resume like blockchain, this whole conversation lasted for about 20-25 min.\nThen he asked me to code some standard coding questions, He asked me to share my screen and write code on any editor of my choice and language as well, I chose VS Code and c++ language.\nQuestions were quite easy but you have to keep on discussing each and every approach with your interviewer so that he can have a good understanding of what you are writing and to help you as well where you stuck.\nTo find the middle of a singly linked list.\nA program to check if a binary tree is BST or not or  A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not.\nHe has more focus on the time complexity of the programs not on space and told me to optimize my code as much as I could, At the last, he was happy with my optimized approach.\nThen he asked whether I had any questions from him or not and I asked a few questions and my interview ended, I was happy as it went so well.\nI started waiting for 2nd interview call and within 2 hours I got the mail to join the meeting for my 2nd technical interview.\n2nd Technical Interview(45 min): This round started with a good pace, he asked me to first code some problems and given me 3 questions to code, though they were easy he wanted to see my approach to solve these problems, \nTo find the column name from a given column number in Excel sheet \nTo reverse every word of a string without reversing the order of words.\nQuestion-based on Kadane Algorithm.\nAfter going through these questions he said so let's start talking about your projects and resume and started discussion about my projects again in detail, then he asked many questions on Node.js as I have written it as my first priority language for web development. \nQuestions on DBMS, indexing in DBMS, NoSQL, and SQL database, how they both operate on data, and explanations for a large system also.\nAfter getting answers to all these questions he asked some additional questions based on OOPS principles and Operating System basics, I answered them all, he was satisfied with the response.\nThen finally he asked his last question that Do you have any questions and I asked a few about the technologies that interns will be going to work on an internship, about the work culture of Microsoft.\nThis round too went well.\nAt around 6 p.m. I got a call for HR interview (the final round)\nHR Managerial Interview(30 min): This was the most mind relaxing and chill interview, HR used to ask about myself, my hobbies, my family background, and all those stuff. Then one more person joined the meeting I thought one of the head managers of the company he asked me some technical questions like to find the least common ancestor in a binary tree and some technical questions based on my projects I answered them all.\nThen HR wanted me to explain one of my good projects to him, I explained my SIH project to him, and he was happy with that.\nThe interview ended with some questions from my side about the culture at Microsoft.\nNote: At last 22 out of 40 students has been selected for SDE Internship at Microsoft\nSome tips\nBe confident throughout the process and if somehow you got stuck ask for some hints from your interviewer.

If arr[i] = 0, you cannot jump forward from that position.
Your task is to find the minimum number of jumps needed to move from the first position in the array to the last position.
Note:  Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.
Examples :
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9]
Output: 3
Explanation: First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3. From here we jump to 5th element with value 9, and from here we will jump to the last.
Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7]
Output: 2
Explanation: First we jump from the 1st to 2nd element and then jump to the last element.
Input: arr = [0, 10, 20]
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot go anywhere from the 1st element.
