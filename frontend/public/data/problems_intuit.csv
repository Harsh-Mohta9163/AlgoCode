The task is to swap elements in the linked list pairwise. For example, if the input list is 1 2 3 4, the resulting list after swaps will be 2 1 4 3.
Note: You need to swap the nodes, not only the data. If only data is swapped then the driver code will print -1.
Examples:
Input: LinkedList: 1->2->2->4->5->6->7->8
Output: 2->1->4->2->6->5->8->7
Explanation: After swapping each pair considering (1,2), (2, 4), (5, 6).. so on as pairs, we get 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 5, 8, 7 as a new linked list.
Input: LinkedList: 1->3->4->7->9->10->1
Output: 3->1->7->4->10->9->1
Explanation: After swapping each pair considering (1,3), (4, 7), (9, 10).. so on as pairs, we get 3, 1, 7, 4, 10, 9, 1 as a new linked list.

After this the HR told that the manager of the team for which they wanted me to select has not come for the interview process that day, so, I will be having one more round with the Manager within couple of days in their office. I waited for 2 weeks and still they havent called. I thought its better to give up. Then one morning the HR called and asked me to come to their office for the interview with the manager. Uff! A relief.. At VMWare Office, before the manager takes the interview, one more person from that team took a technical Interview. They asked me to write the code in Java for the following questions: 1) Given an array with repeated numbers, print the frequencies of each number. 2) There are 3 kinds of balls in a big array. Red, Green, Blue color balls. Arrange them in such a way that all the red balls to the left, Green balls in the middle and Blue balls to the right of the array. 3) Modified the above question such that, the arrangement should be like, [R,G,B,R,G,B,R,G,B]. And discussed various boundary conditions.

Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation?

Find all the rows which are having 1's at same position. Give all sets satisfying this. 2. In a stock market given are price of shares spread over a week. On what day should I buy and what day should i sell to get maximum profit. 3. Being a computer engineer why did I not opt for system side programming than web domain. (I had expr in web domain) 4. I had expr in web domain so he asked: What is the difference between web browser request and ajax call request. -- It is simple, by ajax call partial web page can be loaded. 5. Have you worked on ruby on rails? Round 2 : 1. Given a matrix containing numbers. Find the 0's and make all the rows and columns corresponding to that index as 0. 2. Design a structure for a File Uploader service (eg. Dropbox, google drive). It is a service where multiple people can upload data at the same time and it also lists the top five uploaders (who uploaded the maximum number of files). 3. Puzzle: There is an employer and a worker, the employer has a gold bar of 7 units and he has to give 1unit each on a day for 7 days. The employer has a magical knife which doesn't work once it performs two cuts(1 cut divides the bar into two parts) on the bar. How will you cut so that 1 unit on each day can be given to the worker. 4. Print left view of binary tree. Round 3 : 1. He discussed what things they work on Ola. How these things are implemented.

Tell me about yourself. Meanwhile he(interviewer) looked into my CV and asked about my projects. \nI have done 3 projects so he started discussion CUDA and parallel programming and how you implemented over images to detect edges and how much gain factor achieved. \nsecondly,I have made an project on online voting system so he asked me to draw E-R diagram, schemas and the relationship between them and their functionalities.About (25-30) minutes discussion. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth smallest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n\n3. Suppose you have server where multiple requests are coming at time to,t1,t2...Now suppose a user hits at any particular time t on the server then server should return the last request. you have to design the datastructure for the same. \nI suggested that we can use stack that will return the last request, he then asked me to do for last 10 requests then I suggested to use array of structures which will store request no. and timestamp along with them.Now at any time t we can move 10 elements back but he said that suppose user hits frequently then every time i will have to traverse back again and again so time complexity will be much high, I agreed and suggested another solution similar to LRU implementation so that the requests which are coming frequently can be processed faster. then he modified question that user wants requests of last 1 minute and he gave a hint that is it necessary to store all requests can we not just store requests of every 1 min only,then suddenly it clicked to me, I suggested to use deque for 60 secs now suppose request arrives at 61st sec then we can just add that at rear and remove one from front maintaining a window of 60 seconds.He was satisfied but he want that no deletion should be there so I told him to use circular deque so that we can replace previous elements.He was completely satisfied now with the approach.(About 35 min. discussion) \n\n4. Given an array containing prices of a share of 30 days.A person has 1 share which he can buy and sell any number of times, you have to find the maximum profit which can be earned. \nI suggested one approach to create two auxiliary array MIN from left and MAX from right and traverse both simultaneously if difference between MAX[i] and MIN[i] is greater than maxDiff then update maxDIff and store current index and add to sum if index+1 is not equal to current iteration index and finally return sum.He tried some test cases over my code and found that for some cases it was giving wrong answer,then he asked me that how is my command over dynamic programming,I told I know only the standard ones and no other experience,then he said this question is of DP but he was happy to see my approach.(About 20-25 min.) \n\n\n\n\nRound 3 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. She(interviewer) asked me if I attempted 3rd question in written test, I said I attempted only 1st and 2nd, then she gave me paper and told to implement the 3rd question. \nI suggested an approach to use two arrays of structures(for first characters and last characters) which will contain boolean value to mark presence of character in string and also its index. Now compare two arrays and see that if both arrays have same boolean value and different indices for all first and last characters. If so then strings can form a chain else not.She was in doubt for my solution so she found a testcase where my code was giving wrong answer,so she told me to look for another solution,I came up with another approach and told her that we can make a directed graph from first and last characters and then traverse it in DFS, now suppose if the visited node is visited again and count of total visited nodes is same as total nodes then we can say that strings will form a chain, now she was satisfied with approach and asked me to write code, now as my graph was weak i was in shock,so she said to just write the pseudocode. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth largest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nI suggested to declare a static variable count which will increment count if node visited in inorder and if count becomes k, I will print that node's data and return. Then she asked me how static works and difference between global and static. \n\n3. Given a mobile keypad of say nokia phone and a dictionary which has all the meaningful words which can be formed, suppose now user types some number(input) then your program must suggest all the meaningful words which are present in dictionary.Before implementing this she asked me the datastructure to store the dictionary efficiently and then how will you use this datastructure to make code. \nAt first, I suggested I will store dictionary in 2-D array and lexicograpphically sort it, now suppose user types a number the string starting with that character is searched in the array. she said to reduce complexity because dictionary may contain 1000s of words,then I suggested to use trie datastructure to store and search the string, she was satisfied now and asked me to explain the concept. \n4.Given preorder and postorder of a graph, how can you construct the graph. \nAs I heard this question, i was stuck for 2 minutes but then I said as far as graph is concerned I dont know about it but a unique tree cannot be constructed with preorder and postorder so as graph,so inorder is needed, she was happy and agreed on answer. \n\n\n\n\nRound 4 (Technical) (2:30 hr) \n1. Suppose a linked list is given and there is a loop, you have to find orphan nodes in O(n) time. orphan nodes are the nodes outside the loop. \n\n2. Design a BRTS traffic signalling system such that no two vehicle clashes. Note that BRTS bus will follow the BRTS traffic lights B1,B2,B3,B4 in 4 directions and regular traffic will follow regular traffic lights R1,R2,R3,R4 only. In input only maximum cycle time was given(time after which the process repeates) check for all corner cases (traffic lights have two states only (RED and GREEN)).you have to tell any one possible combination of traffic lights under maximum cycle time. (About 1hr discussion). \n\n3. Suppose a linked list is given but we dont know the count of nodes, you have to find the kth node from last without counting the nodes. \n4. Given an array of n integers such some elements are in the range 0 to n-1 and some out of range may be negative.You have to rearrange array such that all elements which are in range appear on their index and rest appear in sorted manner for indexes not present.This should be done in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nEg- suppose n=6 ,4 5 2 3 6 -3 output= -3,6,2,3,4,5 \n\n5. How can you implement stack using queue/queues. \n6. How can you sort the elements with the help of queue. \nI suggested one O(n) time solution along with O(n) extra space.He asked to do in O(1) space so I suggested deque, he seemed satisfied. \n\nonly 4 were selected till this round (I was one of them) \n\nRound 5 (Bar Raiser) (30 minutes) \n\n1. find the length of longest palindrome in a string starting from index 0. \n2. find if a string A is present in string B or not. \n3. find the length of longest prefix in a string \n\nAfter this 2 were selected finally and unfortunately I was not amongst them as they might have thought i was little stress out.

Platform used for the test was of makemytrip and slightly difficult to understand. Question1: Calculate the power of a ^ b mod c using logn approach.The thing that was to be taken care of was that you did not needed to return or print your answer but you had to store it in their predefined global variable. You could easily find the solution on geeksforgeeks site. Question2: Given a sentence you were supposed to calculate the count of Capital , small letter and number.Question seemed to be quite easy but the pick was that you needed to store the answer in char* output variable in the form of c1:c2:c3 where c1 represent count of capital letter c2 represent count of small letter and c3 represent count of number. (Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,""%d:%d:%d"",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities . Determine the maximum number of non conflicting activities that you can achieve. (Hint : make a structure of start and finish time and sort according to finishing interval) I solved 2 completely and 1 partially Tip:Since they have only one sample test case so even you are not able to solve the coding question just store the hard coded answer in that variable.

Question1: Sort a linklist consisting of 0,1,2\'s. (Hint: I used hashmap of stl in c++ to store the count of 0,1 and 2) Question 2: Given a stock You need to find the maximum profit you can earn .You are allowed to buy and sell as many number of time you can.) Question 3:Design a treeset in java. (Hint:I told him to use BST but he told to think of more optimized way so Ii told AVL and wrote functions for insertion in AVL tree) Question4:Diffrentiate between method overloading and method overriding.What are static blocks in java. Question5: Drilling question on deployment descriptor,struts,mysql. Round3: Personal Interview The interviewer seemed to be exhausted . He asked me that Since you are the last person so all the question you would have asked. So tell me what all question you have asked. I told him distinct palindromic substring in string, LIS, LCS etc students told that you are asking.He thought for a while and told me to write standard bfs code for graph traversal. Question2: You have been given a matrix of character and a dictionary.You need to find the valid words that you can obtain from it and print it. (Hint:I used dfs to find the valid sequence and assumed that all words are stored in a hashmap) After these He asked 6 puzzles to be solved in a given time.

At first glance, everyone would say that just add every time a query has been sent but then there would be no point of asking.

Your task is to rearrange the array and convert it into an array of alternate positive and negative numbers without changing the relative order.
Note:
- Resulting array should start with a positive integer (0 will also be considered as a positive integer).
- If any of the positive or negative integers are exhausted, then add the remaining integers in the answer as it is by maintaining the relative order.
- The array may or may not have the equal number of positive and negative integers.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [9, 4, -2, -1, 5, 0, -5, -3, 2]
Output: [9, -2, 4, -1, 5, -5, 0, -3, 2]
Explanation: The positive numbers are [9, 4, 5, 0, 2] and the negative integers are [-2, -1, -5, -3]. Since, we need to start with the positive integer first and then negative integer and so on (by maintaining the relative order as well), hence we will take 9 from the positive set of elements and then -2 after that 4 and then -1 and so on.
Input: arr[] = [-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8]
Output: [5, -5, 2, -2, 4, -8, 7, 1, 8, 0]
Explanation : The positive numbers are [5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0] and the negative integers are [-5,-2,-8]. According to the given conditions we will start from the positive integer 5 and then -5 and so on. After reaching -8 there are no negative elements left, so according to the given rule, we will add the remaining elements (in this case positive elements are remaining) as it in by maintaining the relative order.
Input: arr[] = [9, 5, -2, -1, 5, 0, -5, -3, 2]
Output: [9, -2, 5, -1, 5, -5, 0, -3, 2]
Explanation: The positive numbers are [9, 5, 5, 0, 2] and the negative integers are [-2, -1, -5, -3].

Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a.

If multiple subarrays have the same sum, return the one with the smallest starting index. If the array contains only negative numbers, return -1.
Note: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: In the given array, every element is non-negative, so the entire array [1, 2, 3] is the valid subarray with the maximum sum.
Input: arr[] = [-1, 2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The only valid non-negative subarray is [2], so the output is [2].
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 5, -7, 2, 6]
Output: [1, 2, 5]
Explanation: The valid non-negative subarrays are [1, 2, 5] and [2, 6]. Both have the same sum of 8, but [1, 2, 5] starts earlier, so it is the preferred subarray.

Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2.

I did write a rough algo just enough to give him a clear idea of what was I thinking and he was satisfied with that ! \nAnd we moved on to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ3) LRU cache implementation using array, stack/queue, doubly linked list, circular linked list, Hash map. \nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1\n\nI did them all very easily, and I also told him the story why was I good at it. He was happy enough to let me go again stating that time was a constrain and they had to take further interviews too ! \n\n  \n\nRound 4: HIRING MANAGER ROUND \n\nI was pretty confident that if I make it till here, I will get the job too, which is what happened. \nI entered the room, He asked me ""How was I "" and I told him"" I was hungry""......that did set the tone of the interview to a casual talk and made him comfortable with me. 5-10 mins into the interview, he commented that I was very honest. ANd so went on the conversation and the usual interview Questions. \n\nWhere do you see yourselves in 5 years? \n\nWhat is your strength and weakness? To which I answered as hard working, being both my weakness and strength and justified it . \n\nHe asked me about my story if JEE and getting into this college. \n\nHow did I grow technically and personality wise in the last 3 years? \n\nand usual questions like that ....to which I gave pretty interesting answers ! \n\nWe then discussed a little about any one of my projects of my choice and I some how led that discussion to about how every college group project is like one person doing the entire work, to him I also told that in one of the projects I did the entire work  and everyone got the credit, and how once in second year my partner did the entire project and I got pointers for it too. He was convinced that I was very honest and true !! \n\nAt last he asked me if I had any questions for him . \n\nI asked him only one question, which was that just in case if I get selected for this job at flipkart or even if I do not, what is that one thing that I should improve or learn about my technical part or my personality part. He did not say anything about my technical skills, He only said that he got a picture that I was not passionate enough . I also joined hands and agreed on it and gave a little justification on it. He also said that  I should not take that personally and that he only siad that because I asked so. \n\nThat is where the HM round ended. I got up, we shook hands and he said that mine was the best HM interview he had in the entire day(my was 2nd last interview of the day), and that he had an interesting conversation with me and truly enjoyed it ! \n\n  \n\nI was on Cloud 7 at the end of this interview. \n\nNext day the results were announced. Out of the 12 who appeared for the HM round. Only one candidate was rejected. 9 people (inclusive of me) we awarded  6 month internship + Full time job after that. 2 were awarded a 6 month internship and they would then evaluate their performance and see if they should hire them for full time or not !

I was interviewed for Associate Software Engineer and have an experience of an year, first by telephonic round and then F2F interview.\nRound-1 Telephonic around: 70 minutes (Taken by 2 persons)\n1. All they asked at first was about Projects done in my company and at college level. 2. Then main thing they ask was OS and its concepts:      \na. Memory management.      \nb. CPU scheduling.      \nc. Deadlock and its real time examples.      \nd. Questions on how two processes can communicate in OS, give different ways.\n3. Coding questions:      \nReverse a linked list.\nPrint left view of a binary tree.\nImplement your own memcpy. After completion of this round they asked me if I can travel to Hyderabad for further rounds.At 7th January 2017 I gave F2F interview.\nRound-2 F2F:120 minutes\nHe started with simple intro then explained me the position for which interview was going on. 1. Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word \'is\' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find \'is\' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using ""strcmp"" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1. Then he started with questions on OS      \na. Process and thread difference.      \nb. How will you handle 2 thread working on same MAP.Then asked several questions on mutex and different types of locking systems.      \nc. Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation?

Write your own sqrt() function. the function should return square root if it is a perfect square else return floor(sqrt(x)) \n2. Given an array containing positive and negative integers. you have to find the smallest missing positive number. your code should run in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n3. Given an array of strings, find whether the strings can be chained or not to form a circle. A string x can be put before another string y if last character of x is same as first character of y. \n\nAfter round-1 , 19 people were shortlisted for the interviews. \n\n\n\n\nRound 2 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. Tell me about yourself. Meanwhile he(interviewer) looked into my CV and asked about my projects. \nI have done 3 projects so he started discussion CUDA and parallel programming and how you implemented over images to detect edges and how much gain factor achieved. \nsecondly,I have made an project on online voting system so he asked me to draw E-R diagram, schemas and the relationship between them and their functionalities.About (25-30) minutes discussion. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth smallest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \n\n3. Suppose you have server where multiple requests are coming at time to,t1,t2...Now suppose a user hits at any particular time t on the server then server should return the last request. you have to design the datastructure for the same. \nI suggested that we can use stack that will return the last request, he then asked me to do for last 10 requests then I suggested to use array of structures which will store request no. and timestamp along with them.Now at any time t we can move 10 elements back but he said that suppose user hits frequently then every time i will have to traverse back again and again so time complexity will be much high, I agreed and suggested another solution similar to LRU implementation so that the requests which are coming frequently can be processed faster. then he modified question that user wants requests of last 1 minute and he gave a hint that is it necessary to store all requests can we not just store requests of every 1 min only,then suddenly it clicked to me, I suggested to use deque for 60 secs now suppose request arrives at 61st sec then we can just add that at rear and remove one from front maintaining a window of 60 seconds.He was satisfied but he want that no deletion should be there so I told him to use circular deque so that we can replace previous elements.He was completely satisfied now with the approach.(About 35 min. discussion) \n\n4. Given an array containing prices of a share of 30 days.A person has 1 share which he can buy and sell any number of times, you have to find the maximum profit which can be earned. \nI suggested one approach to create two auxiliary array MIN from left and MAX from right and traverse both simultaneously if difference between MAX[i] and MIN[i] is greater than maxDiff then update maxDIff and store current index and add to sum if index+1 is not equal to current iteration index and finally return sum.He tried some test cases over my code and found that for some cases it was giving wrong answer,then he asked me that how is my command over dynamic programming,I told I know only the standard ones and no other experience,then he said this question is of DP but he was happy to see my approach.(About 20-25 min.) \n\n\n\n\nRound 3 (Technical) (1:30 hr) \n1. She(interviewer) asked me if I attempted 3rd question in written test, I said I attempted only 1st and 2nd, then she gave me paper and told to implement the 3rd question. \nI suggested an approach to use two arrays of structures(for first characters and last characters) which will contain boolean value to mark presence of character in string and also its index. Now compare two arrays and see that if both arrays have same boolean value and different indices for all first and last characters. If so then strings can form a chain else not.She was in doubt for my solution so she found a testcase where my code was giving wrong answer,so she told me to look for another solution,I came up with another approach and told her that we can make a directed graph from first and last characters and then traverse it in DFS, now suppose if the visited node is visited again and count of total visited nodes is same as total nodes then we can say that strings will form a chain, now she was satisfied with approach and asked me to write code, now as my graph was weak i was in shock,so she said to just write the pseudocode. \n\n2. Given a BST, you have to find the kth largest element in it in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nI suggested to declare a static variable count which will increment count if node visited in inorder and if count becomes k, I will print that node's data and return. Then she asked me how static works and difference between global and static. \n\n3. Given a mobile keypad of say nokia phone and a dictionary which has all the meaningful words which can be formed, suppose now user types some number(input) then your program must suggest all the meaningful words which are present in dictionary.Before implementing this she asked me the datastructure to store the dictionary efficiently and then how will you use this datastructure to make code. \nAt first, I suggested I will store dictionary in 2-D array and lexicograpphically sort it, now suppose user types a number the string starting with that character is searched in the array. she said to reduce complexity because dictionary may contain 1000s of words,then I suggested to use trie datastructure to store and search the string, she was satisfied now and asked me to explain the concept. \n4.Given preorder and postorder of a graph, how can you construct the graph. \nAs I heard this question, i was stuck for 2 minutes but then I said as far as graph is concerned I dont know about it but a unique tree cannot be constructed with preorder and postorder so as graph,so inorder is needed, she was happy and agreed on answer. \n\n\n\n\nRound 4 (Technical) (2:30 hr) \n1. Suppose a linked list is given and there is a loop, you have to find orphan nodes in O(n) time. orphan nodes are the nodes outside the loop. \n\n2. Design a BRTS traffic signalling system such that no two vehicle clashes. Note that BRTS bus will follow the BRTS traffic lights B1,B2,B3,B4 in 4 directions and regular traffic will follow regular traffic lights R1,R2,R3,R4 only. In input only maximum cycle time was given(time after which the process repeates) check for all corner cases (traffic lights have two states only (RED and GREEN)).you have to tell any one possible combination of traffic lights under maximum cycle time. (About 1hr discussion). \n\n3. Suppose a linked list is given but we dont know the count of nodes, you have to find the kth node from last without counting the nodes. \n4. Given an array of n integers such some elements are in the range 0 to n-1 and some out of range may be negative.You have to rearrange array such that all elements which are in range appear on their index and rest appear in sorted manner for indexes not present.This should be done in O(n) time and O(1) space. \nEg- suppose n=6 ,4 5 2 3 6 -3 output= -3,6,2,3,4,5 \n\n5. How can you implement stack using queue/queues. \n6. How can you sort the elements with the help of queue. \nI suggested one O(n) time solution along with O(n) extra space.He asked to do in O(1) space so I suggested deque, he seemed satisfied. \n\nonly 4 were selected till this round (I was one of them) \n\nRound 5 (Bar Raiser) (30 minutes) \n\n1. find the length of longest palindrome in a string starting from index 0. \n2. find if a string A is present in string B or not. \n3. find the length of longest prefix in a string \n\nAfter this 2 were selected finally and unfortunately I was not amongst them as they might have thought i was little stress out.

Question1: Calculate the power of a ^ b mod c using logn approach.The thing that was to be taken care of was that you did not needed to return or print your answer but you had to store it in their predefined global variable. You could easily find the solution on geeksforgeeks site. Question2: Given a sentence you were supposed to calculate the count of Capital , small letter and number.Question seemed to be quite easy but the pick was that you needed to store the answer in char* output variable in the form of c1:c2:c3 where c1 represent count of capital letter c2 represent count of small letter and c3 represent count of number. (Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,""%d:%d:%d"",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities .

The details of each edge in the graph is given to you in the form of list of list.
Your task is to find the number of lucky permutations of the given array.
An array permutation is said to be lucky if for every node Vi  [1 <= i <= N-1] in the array there exists an edge between the nodes Vi and Vi+1 in the given graph.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 3, M = 2
arr = {1, 2, 3}
graph = {{3, 1}, {1, 2}}
Output:
2
Explanation:
All possible permutations of the
array are as follows-
{1,2,3}: There is an edge between 1 and
2 in the graph but not betwen 2 and 3.
{2,1,3}: There is an edge between (2,1)
and (1,3) in the graph.
{3,1,2}: There is an edge between (3,1)
and (1,2) in the graph.
Out of the 3 possible permutations,
2 are lucky. Therefore, answer is 2.

Note:
- Resulting array should start with a positive integer (0 will also be considered as a positive integer).
- If any of the positive or negative integers are exhausted, then add the remaining integers in the answer as it is by maintaining the relative order.
- The array may or may not have the equal number of positive and negative integers.

According to the given conditions we will start from the positive integer 5 and then -5 and so on.

There is a function f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c , apply this function on A where x is any ith element from array A and a,b,c belongs to set of real numbers. Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon.

This was a medium level question, 7/11 test case passed using brute force (O(n^2)). An accurate solution of which is actually in O (n), but i modified my code and managed to get all the 11 test cases right using just a slight modification in my brute force approach! \n\nQ3)A matrix was given, the solution to which was by applying  BFS on it but not exactly that. I could not understand the problem enough as I was running out of time ! \nThe name of the Question was ""Marathon"" and said was a lot similar to some other famour problem named ""Rat in a maze"". \n\n In this round out of 150 students, 22 were shortlisted for interviews, and 10 were kept on waiting list. \n\nRound 2: TECHNICAL  I \n\nIn technical round one, all of us were asked 3 questions. The level of questions was actually easy, and most were selected only if they could answer all of the 3 right ! \n\nQ1) N-1 elements in an array from 1 to n, find the missing one! \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1\n\nI answered it easily so he added the constrain of over flowing numbers, which took me a little while but I got it \n\nQ2) K distance sort \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nearly-sorted-algorithm/0\n\nHe had clearly stated me that this can be done using normal sorting algo in O(nlogn), but I had to give a more optimized one. \n\nI proposed a solution using a stack, which some how worked for the test case that he gave me, but he proved it wrong and gave me a hint to use another data structure, I got the hint and realised it  was to be done using min heap. Time complexity of which was O(nlogk) ! \n\nQ3)Circular tour \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/circular-tour/1\n\n For this question i gave him a more optimized solution than brute force but with the same complexity, but he did not give me much time for this question as they were running late on schedule. \n\nLater I got to know from sources that I was rated 3.7 out of 5 in this round, which was more than a lot of others. \n\nRound 3: TECHNICAL   II \n\n17 out of 22 made it to this round. \n\nIn this round the questions asked were tough, but the interviewer was very suggestive and kept dropping hints. \n\nQ1)Sum of minimum elements of all sub arrays. \n\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-minimum-elements-of-all-subarrays/ \n\nI gave an immediate solution in nlogn time, but he asked me to optimize it. He gave me hell a lot of hints but I could not solve this easy question. He then said that they are running out of time so let\'s move to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ2)Cut off trees for golf \n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/ \n\nAfter a little bit of pickering I was able to give him a solution in O(r^2c^2), but he did not ask me to improve it. He asked me to write the code for it and tell me what algo was I using. I did write a rough algo just enough to give him a clear idea of what was I thinking and he was satisfied with that ! \nAnd we moved on to the next question. \n\n  \n\nQ3) LRU cache implementation using array, stack/queue, doubly linked list, circular linked list, Hash map. \nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1\n\nI did them all very easily, and I also told him the story why was I good at it. He was happy enough to let me go again stating that time was a constrain and they had to take further interviews too ! \n\n  \n\nRound 4: HIRING MANAGER ROUND \n\nI was pretty confident that if I make it till here, I will get the job too, which is what happened. \nI entered the room, He asked me ""How was I "" and I told him"" I was hungry""......that did set the tone of the interview to a casual talk and made him comfortable with me. 5-10 mins into the interview, he commented that I was very honest. ANd so went on the conversation and the usual interview Questions. \n\nWhere do you see yourselves in 5 years? \n\nWhat is your strength and weakness? To which I answered as hard working, being both my weakness and strength and justified it . \n\nHe asked me about my story if JEE and getting into this college. \n\nHow did I grow technically and personality wise in the last 3 years? \n\nand usual questions like that ....to which I gave pretty interesting answers ! \n\nWe then discussed a little about any one of my projects of my choice and I some how led that discussion to about how every college group project is like one person doing the entire work, to him I also told that in one of the projects I did the entire work  and everyone got the credit, and how once in second year my partner did the entire project and I got pointers for it too. He was convinced that I was very honest and true !! \n\nAt last he asked me if I had any questions for him . \n\nI asked him only one question, which was that just in case if I get selected for this job at flipkart or even if I do not, what is that one thing that I should improve or learn about my technical part or my personality part. He did not say anything about my technical skills, He only said that he got a picture that I was not passionate enough . I also joined hands and agreed on it and gave a little justification on it. He also said that  I should not take that personally and that he only siad that because I asked so. \n\nThat is where the HM round ended. I got up, we shook hands and he said that mine was the best HM interview he had in the entire day(my was 2nd last interview of the day), and that he had an interesting conversation with me and truly enjoyed it ! \n\n  \n\nI was on Cloud 7 at the end of this interview. \n\nNext day the results were announced. Out of the 12 who appeared for the HM round. Only one candidate was rejected. 9 people (inclusive of me) we awarded  6 month internship + Full time job after that. 2 were awarded a 6 month internship and they would then evaluate their performance and see if they should hire them for full time or not !
