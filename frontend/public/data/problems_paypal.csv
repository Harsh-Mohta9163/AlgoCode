Explanation:
The array contains 2 (1’s), 1 (2’s) and 2 (5’s), since the number of frequency of 1 and 5 are the same i.e. 2 times. Therefore, this array does not satisfy the condition.

Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.

Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 4 5 2. The reversed array will be 2 5 4.

The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.

Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
Examples:
Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.
Input: prices[] = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Here the prices are in decreasing order, hence if we buy any day then we cannot sell it at a greater price. Hence, the answer is 0.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
arr = [1, 1, 2, 5, 5]
Output:
false
Explanation:
The array contains 2 (1’s), 1 (2’s) and 2 (5’s), since the number of frequency of 1 and 5 are the same i.e. 2 times. Therefore, this array does not satisfy the condition.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 10
