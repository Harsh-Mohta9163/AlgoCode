There is a function f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c , apply this function on A where x is any ith element from array A and a,b,c belongs to set of real numbers. Will f(A) will be sorted, if not then sort it in O(n). It is very easy if you still remember concepts of quadratic equation from maths. I did not remember so he helped me. Logic is that any quadratic equation is represented by parabola on graph and graph has minimum value at dy/dx = 0,i.e, 2*a*x + b = 0. Both sides of this point graph keeps increasing/decreasing to the infinity depending upon value of a. Calculate value of x = -b/(2*a). find it in sorted array or find its ceiling in log n. starting from this point to both ends, perform merge sort. Round IV 1. implement LRU cache 2. Implement following. There are three type of request : i) www.someurl.com/conn_id=?&timeout=? -: for this conn_id you will wait for timeout sec and after that return reponse, in meantime you can get some more requests of any one of three types ii) www.someurl.com/stat/ -: return all id waiting to timeout along with their remaining timeout interval ii) www.someurl.com/kill/conn_id=? -: end wait timeout of this conn_id and return response for this conn_id I gave a solution with heap. He asked how to handle case when a request is waiting for timout and new request came in meantime. How to do server side scalability in this case. 3. He asked about current work and technologies I am working upon. I said Java, Spring MVC for backend and html,css, javascript for front end and suddenly he asked what is difference between Java and javascript. Could not figure out at that time. Javascript is also an object oriented language an can be used at server side like node js. Still there are lot of differences.\n  Related Practice Problems\nTwo Mirror Trees\nLevel order traversal Line by Line\nNodes at given distance in binary tree\nLRU Cache\nSearch in a Rotated Array\nLevel order traversal in spiral form\nKadane's Algorithm\nAll Practice Problems for Hike !\n\nComment\nMore info\nCampus Training Program\nNext Article\nHike Interview Experience | Set 5""}]",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/level-order-traversal-line-by-line/1?page=1&company=Microsoft&sortBy=latest,2025-06-11T12:11:17.055649,GeeksforGeeks,Level Order Line by Line,Easy,53.78%,83K+,20m,"Given a Binary Tree, your task is to find its level order traversal.

Implementation of queue using two stacks and some modification on that. Finding pair in a given array such that sum is equal to given value. Then he modified for negative numbers. Check if a given tree is binary search tree or not with full code. Child sum problem on binary tree told to write code also. One puzzle related to coin and two rooms. Third round: Only one question in this round. I have to design a dictionary of words such that if any word is entered then it should give meaning for all anagrams for that word. We discussed for one hour. First I told about using try data structure to make dictionary and generate all anagrams of that word then searching each words. But he is not satisfied. Then I came up with some modification in structure of try data structure still not satisfied. Then I come up with multilevel hashing Technique. He somewhat satisfied. Fourth round: It was final round and only two people were selected for this. Puzzle: There will be 17 buckets and some 2197(don’t remember exact number) apples. You have to put these apples in buckets such that if I ask any number of apples then just give any number of buckets such that apples in those buckets should equal to that value.

Is it possible to declare final variable in abstract class. 4. What is externalization. Android : Lots of basic questions: You need to provide more area for checking/unchecking checkbox than the default area of checkbox. How would you do it. How would you implement zoom in zoom out functionality in Android. How do you implement GCM push notifications. What things would you do in each lifecycle method of activity? What is IllegalStateException in Android? Any scenario when you encounter it and how to solve it? Advantages and disadvantages of using fragment. How would you implement swipe animation in Android. How do you detect whether keyboard is open in an Android app. And some more. But I don't exactly remember. DS: Implement queue using 2 stacks. After this, the interviewer seemed satisfied with my responses. F2F Round 2 : Android design questions: 1. You have a textview(3 lines) and a button below it. On clicking the button textview whole content should show. (Content is very large but due to 3 lines initially its not shown completely). You need to add animation while showing the full text of textview. How would you design this. 2. Some question related to showing images (for adult and child, like in flight booking system, we have 2 buttons for adding and removing adults/child). When there is 1 adult and 1 child, it should show as AC where A and C are icons for adult and child. On adding 1 more adult, it should show as AAC instead of ACA. How would you design such a system.

The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a profit then return 0.
Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
Examples:
Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.
Input: prices[] = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Here the prices are in decreasing order, hence if we buy any day then we cannot sell it at a greater price. Hence, the answer is 0.
Input: prices[] = [1, 3, 6, 9, 11]
Output: 10
Explanation: Since the array is sorted in increasing order, we can make maximum profit by buying at price[0] and selling at price[n-1].

(i) a next pointer to the next node,
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.
Each of the sub-linked-list is in sorted order.
Flatten the Link List such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order.
Note: The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of next pointer.
Example 1:
Input:

Around 120 wrote test, 10 were selected for next round. Second round: It took around 1 and half hour two people were there. All rounds were purely technical. Questions are, Tell me about yourself. Implementation of queue using two stacks and some modification on that. Finding pair in a given array such that sum is equal to given value. Then he modified for negative numbers. Check if a given tree is binary search tree or not with full code. Child sum problem on binary tree told to write code also. One puzzle related to coin and two rooms. Third round: Only one question in this round. I have to design a dictionary of words such that if any word is entered then it should give meaning for all anagrams for that word. We discussed for one hour. First I told about using try data structure to make dictionary and generate all anagrams of that word then searching each words. But he is not satisfied. Then I came up with some modification in structure of try data structure still not satisfied. Then I come up with multilevel hashing Technique. He somewhat satisfied. Fourth round: It was final round and only two people were selected for this. Puzzle: There will be 17 buckets and some 2197(don’t remember exact number) apples. You have to put these apples in buckets such that if I ask any number of apples then just give any number of buckets such that apples in those buckets should equal to that value. Hint, arranged as bits arranged in binary representation of numbers. Finding loop in a linked list. He first asked you already know this question I told yes sir. Then he asked will it work if by changing fast pointer and slow pointer with difference of 3, 4, 5 nodes. Addition of two linked lists with full code. Numbers are in reverse order and all border conditions should be considered like, lengths are not equal. First he told to write for positive numbers I wrote using recursion. Then he told to write negative numbers. We both were told to wait outside. After few minutes they told only I am selected.
