There exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= k such that any egg dropped from a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped from or below floor f will not break.
There are few rules given below.
An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
A broken egg must be discarded.
The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
If the egg doesn't break at a certain floor, it will not break at any floor below.
If the egg breaks on a certain floor, it will break on any floor above.
Return the minimum number of moves you need to determine the value of f with certainty.
Examples:
Input: n = 2, k = 36
Output: 8
Explanation: In all the situations, 8 maximum moves are required to find the maximum floor. Following is the strategy to do so:
Drop from floor 8 → If breaks, check 1-7 sequentially.
Drop from floor 15 → If breaks, check 9-14.
Drop from floor 21 → If breaks, check 16-20.
Drop from floor 26 → If breaks, check 22-25.
Drop from floor 30 → If breaks, check 27-29.
Drop from floor 33 → If breaks, check 31-32.
Drop from floor 35 → If breaks, check 34.
Drop from floor 36 → Final check.
Input: n = 1, k = 36
Output: 36
Explanation: Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 36 droppings.
