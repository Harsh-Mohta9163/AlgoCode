The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a profit then return 0.
Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
Examples:
Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.
Input: prices[] = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Here the prices are in decreasing order, hence if we buy any day then we cannot sell it at a greater price. Hence, the answer is 0.

Question1: Calculate the power of a ^ b mod c using logn approach.The thing that was to be taken care of was that you did not needed to return or print your answer but you had to store it in their predefined global variable. You could easily find the solution on geeksforgeeks site. Question2: Given a sentence you were supposed to calculate the count of Capital , small letter and number.Question seemed to be quite easy but the pick was that you needed to store the answer in char* output variable in the form of c1:c2:c3 where c1 represent count of capital letter c2 represent count of small letter and c3 represent count of number. (Hint use sprintf to store your answer in formatted way in the variable sprintf(output,""%d:%d:%d"",c1,c2,c3); ) Question3: Activity Scheduling problem You are given 2 arrays representing the starting and finishing time of activities . Determine the maximum number of non conflicting activities that you can achieve. (Hint : make a structure of start and finish time and sort according to finishing interval) I solved 2 completely and 1 partially Tip:Since they have only one sample test case so even you are not able to solve the coding question just store the hard coded answer in that variable.

I was interviewed for Associate Software Engineer and have an experience of an year, first by telephonic round and then F2F interview.\nRound-1 Telephonic around: 70 minutes (Taken by 2 persons)\n1. All they asked at first was about Projects done in my company and at college level. 2. Then main thing they ask was OS and its concepts:      \na. Memory management.      \nb. CPU scheduling.      \nc. Deadlock and its real time examples.      \nd. Questions on how two processes can communicate in OS, give different ways.\n3. Coding questions:      \nReverse a linked list.\nPrint left view of a binary tree.\nImplement your own memcpy. After completion of this round they asked me if I can travel to Hyderabad for further rounds.At 7th January 2017 I gave F2F interview.\nRound-2 F2F:120 minutes\nHe started with simple intro then explained me the position for which interview was going on. 1. Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word \'is\' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find \'is\' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using ""strcmp"" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1. Then he started with questions on OS      \na. Process and thread difference.      \nb. How will you handle 2 thread working on same MAP.Then asked several questions on mutex and different types of locking systems.      \nc. Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation?

I was interviewed for Associate Software Engineer and have an experience of an year, first by telephonic round and then F2F interview.\nRound-1 Telephonic around: 70 minutes (Taken by 2 persons)\n1. All they asked at first was about Projects done in my company and at college level. 2. Then main thing they ask was OS and its concepts:      \na. Memory management.      \nb. CPU scheduling.      \nc. Deadlock and its real time examples.      \nd. Questions on how two processes can communicate in OS, give different ways.\n3. Coding questions:      \nReverse a linked list.\nPrint left view of a binary tree.\nImplement your own memcpy. After completion of this round they asked me if I can travel to Hyderabad for further rounds.At 7th January 2017 I gave F2F interview.\nRound-2 F2F:120 minutes\nHe started with simple intro then explained me the position for which interview was going on. 1. Then after he asked me about all of the projects on which I have worked till this time. He also asked different situations like how you use to fix the issues of memory overflow, crashes in your current company.\n2. Questions on big and little endian:      \na. Their notation and what are the different OS which one is big endian and which one is little endian.      \nb. You have one code now this code must work on both little and big endian in same way how will you do that: I gave solution of having different macros for different OS like for linux, windows it will work as little endian and another macro for SUN and motorola OS it will work as big endian.      \nc. Some more explanations on this topic only.\n3. Find the word in given para :\nThis is my island of love and it is meant for kids of 10 years.\nNow you have to find word \'is\' in this given para(word can come in other word) whose count is 4. Then implement the same logic, if you have to find \'is\' if it separate word. They asked me the different solutions for this question using ""strcmp"" and your own logic. I gave solutions via hashMap and normal word searching and strcmp.\n4. He gave me 10 output questions based on pointers. 5. Again he asked me some basic questions on programming like one x.h file is included in another y.cpp file and x.h file is included in z.h file and z.h is included in a.cpp now asked me several questions like which file have which variable accessed and what is the order of print statements and etc questions.\nRound-3 F2F: 80 minutes\nIn this round he asked me about questions asked in previous round. 1. Then he started with questions on OS      \na. Process and thread difference.      \nb. How will you handle 2 thread working on same MAP.Then asked several questions on mutex and different types of locking systems.      \nc. Questions on Storage classes in C. 2.\nReverse the bits of a number.\nMin distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree\nIn the above question he asked me about call stack of the program. 4. Use of stack and queue DS. 5. Difference between stack and heap memory. Asked me to explain by writing a simple program. 6. Questions on Function pointers and usage.\nRound-4 F2F: 80 minutes\nThis round was more logical and was tough because in this round I was asked basic questions on pointers and how memory is accessed by different functions. 1. He asked me to explain Inline function.Then asked me which are the cases where inline would not work.He asked me internals of inline how it works and why this function works more faster then any other normal function.He asked me is there is any common thing between function pointer and inline function. Afterwards he also explained some points in this topic to me. 2. He told me to write my own sizeof operator (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/) 3.\nProgram to Detect loop in a circular linked list.\n4. He also asked the question : Reverse the bits of a number and count the number of set bits in the given number. 5. Many questions on static variable and static function.\nRound-5 F2F: 20-30 minutes [Manager round, HR round]\n1. He asked me about my previous company and projects done there. 2. Then explained about the position. 3. He asked me about my joining and all and all basic questions is work interesting or not. 4. Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation?
